## LLM-assisted Climate Mobility Knowledge Graph: A Test
### Description
This is a very first test on LLM assisted climate mobility knowledge graph construction, using prompting.
I first used [this tool](https://github.com/titipata/scipdf_parser#installation) in 'pdf2text' for parsing those papers into dictionaries (1->1), with section names as keys and section contents as values, then cleaned those dictionaries a bit, removing unrelated parts.
