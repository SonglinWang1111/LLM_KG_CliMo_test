In an EACH-FOR case study survey among 203 internal migrants from north-west Ghana, the vast majority mentioned environmental reasons for leaving their homes. 1 The respondents -setler farmers living in rural areas of Brong Ahafo Region in Central Ghana -said they decided to migrate because of scarcity of fertile land, unreliable rainfall, low crop yields and/or food security problems. A minority mentioned non-environmental reasons for migrating -lack of nonfarm income opportunities, family conlicts, witchcrat, catle thet and the desire to be free and independent.\\nThe survey indings indicate that this group of migrants indeed experienced a degree of environmental push. However, such indings are not enough to adequately assess the environment-migration link. For example, respondents with low levels of formal education and poor access to information will not mention certain underlying causes of migration. Complex explanations of migration will be hard to distil from this type of interviews whereas the environment easily becomes part of local discourses on migration because farmers experience environmental conditions every day.\\nIf the environment is an important factor in explaining migration from the West African interior savanna to the moister forest and coastal zones, one could reasonably expect the propensity to migrate to be higher a) in environmentally less wellendowed areas and b) in times of increased environmental scarcity.

To this end we assemble a cross-country panel data set that allows us to estimate the determinants of urbanization. The results of our econometric analysis suggest that climatic change, as proxied by rainfall, has acted to change urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa but not elsewhere in the developing world. Moreover, this link has become stronger since decolonization, which is likely due to the often simultaneous lifting of legislation prohibiting the free internal movement of native Africans.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"It has been noted that historically economic development and urbanization have tended to go hand in hand, and the legitimacy of this link continues to draw considerable attention; see, for instance, the 1999/2000 issue of the World Development Report (World Bank [36]). One notable exception to this stylized fact, however, has been sub-Saharan Africa. More specifically, while sub-Saharan Africa's growth rate of urbanization, defined as the share of urban to total population, has been extraordinary by international standards, averaging 140 percent between the 1960s and the 1990s-which is a rate of ten times that of OECD countries and 2.5 times that of the rest of the developing world-it does not appear to have been coupled with an improvement in economic wealth in this region of the world; see Fay and Opal [11] and World Bank [36]. 1  Furthermore, it is now a well known fact that internal migration has been a major factor fueling the growth of Africa's cities. For example, it has been estimated that rural-urban migration has accounted for roughly half of urban growth in Africa between the 1960s and 1990s (Zachariah and Conde [37], Kelley [18]), with large variations across countries. These evolutions and further predicted increases in urbanization have consequently raised concerns about the capacity of Africa's urban system to absorb such massive movements of population and its impact on sustainable development.\\nA natural starting point in trying to understand the lack of connection between urbanization and development in sub-Saharan Africa is to analyze the potential determinants of urbanization on this continent. From the general literature on what causes urbanization, one can essentially distinguish between two groups of explanations of rural-urban movements, which we loosely label as demand pull and supply push type. With regard to the former, it is generally assumed that modern sectors of production, which generally locate in urban areas, have higher rates of productivity and monetary reward than the traditional rural agricultural sector and hence attract urban-rural migrants. As highlighted in the seminal work by Harris and Todaro [14], this may happen despite persistent unemployment in urban areas since potential migrants base their decision on their expected income. Thus, urbanization in developing countries may result from the existence of a market failure, leading to the so-called over-urbanization thesis; see, amongst others, Gugler [13]. More recently, by adding rural-urban migration to a standard monocentric city model, Brueckner [7] points as well to the importance of the income gap between urban and rural areas as a determinant of urbanization in developing countries. Apart from the general urbanization issue, several studies have also focused in particular on explaining the spectacular and arguably unsustainable growth of mega cities, i.e., urban concentration. Using a sample of developed and developing countries, Ades and Glaeser [1] show, for instance, that rent-seeking activities have been paramount in explaining the rise of such mega-cities, while Davis and Henderson's [8] results on panel data support these findings, highlighting more generally the importance of political factors in explaining the growth of mega cities.\\nSupply-push explanations, in contrast, essentially refer to the possibility that other factors directly affecting the rural sector have favored population movements towards cities but may not necessarily result in productivity improvements. These may include displacement of population due to civil conflicts or other more direct determinants of agricultural production. As such, rural to urban migration can be seen as a survival strategy, affecting especially the poorest segment of the rural population. 2 One particular supply-push type factor that may have been important in determining urbanization in Africa, and that is the focus of the current paper, is that of climate change. In particular, long-run climate change scenarios tend to suggest that extreme climate variations and, more specifically, water shortages, are likely to cause abrupt changes in human settlements and urbanization patterns in sub-Saharan Africa more than anywhere else in 1 Moreover, according to UN [32] projections, sub-Saharan Africa's urbanization should further increase by about 3.5 percent annually in the next 30 years. 2 Educational levels seem to play little role in determining migration in many developing countries, as indicated by the fact that many migrants work in low skilled informal sector jobs, such as street vending, see Todaro [31].\\nthe world; see Watson et al. [34]. It has also relatively recently been noted that rainfall in Africa has, in general, been on a decline since its relative peak in the 1960s; see, for instance, Nicholson [27,28]. The specific effects of climate change on rural-urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa have, however, as of date been poorly documented. A particularly important starting-point is that sub-Saharan African agriculture is especially dependent on rainfall compared to most other developing countries, which triggers the potential impact of rainfall variations on economic activity; see Barrios et al. [2]. These impacts are, in turn, especially pronounced in rural areas where agriculture concentrates, and thus potentially affect rural-urban migration patterns. In this regard, one should note that, although climate per se is seldom the direct root of migration, except in extreme cases like floods or droughts, it clearly can, however, exacerbate difficult living conditions at the margin of subsistence.\\nThe current paper provides empirical evidence showing that climatic change has been an important determinant of rural-urban migration in sub-Saharan Africa. More generally, our focus is linked to the concept of eco-refugees or environmental refugees, where environmental conditions may influence socio-economic conditions and hence migration (Myers [26]). 3,4 We specifically set out to investigate the role of the general decline in rainfall on the African continent since the 1960s in shaping its urbanization patterns. In this regard we take advantage of a new comprehensive cross-country data set on rainfall and commonly used United Nations data on urbanization. Placing these in an econometric specification of the determinants of urbanization we then explicitly test for the impact of rainfall on urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa using other developing countries as a natural control group. Our results show that rainfall has indeed been an important determinant of urbanization growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, we find that this effect was much stronger after decolonization when there were less restrictions on migration in most countries.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline a simple theoretical factor specific framework to demonstrate how rainfall may affect urbanization patterns. In Section 3, we discuss Africa's rural sector vulnerability to shortages in rainfall. Section 4 describes our data and provides summary statistics. Our econometric framework and estimation results are presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks are provided in the final section.\",\n",
       "  'The link between rural-urban migration and rainfall: a specific factors framework': 'The specific factors model (Jones [17]) is a particularly useful theoretical framework in order to conceptualize the link between rural-urban migration and changes in rainfall. Here we use a slightly modified version of this model in order to consider the effect of variations in rainfall in the agriculture sector. Accordingly, suppose we have an economy that has two industries, the rural/agricultural sector (A) and the urban/manufacturing sector (M), and three factors of production, \"effective\" land input (L), labor (N ), and capital (K). Here, land is specific to the agricultural sector whereas capital is specific to the manufacturing sector, and labor is supposed to be freely mobile between the two sectors. Thus, the production function in the rural/agricultural and the urban/manufacturing sectors are\\nY A = L (R) 1-α A N α A A ,(1)\\nY M = K 1-α M N α M M (2)\\nwhere K stands for capital endowment of the economy and α A (α M ) is the elasticity of agricultural (manufacturing) output with respect to labor. Unlike the standard specific factors model, we assume that the effective land input depends on the level of rainfall (R), that is, L(R). In order to see the positive impact of rainfall on the effective land input, we assume L (R) > 0. We also assume that the economy is small in the sense that prices of the two sectors, pA and pM , are exogenously given.\\nFor simplicity we postulate that both the agricultural and the manufacturing sectors exhibit constant returns to scale technologies. In this case, first order conditions lead to the following results:\\npA ∂Y A ∂N A = w ⇒ N A = α 1 1-α A A w pA - 1 1-α A L(R), (3\\n)\\npM ∂Y M ∂N M = w ⇒ N M = α 1 1-α M M w pM - 1 1-α M K, (4\\n)\\nwhere N A /N M is the mass of workers in the agricultural/manufacturing sector. From Eqs. ( 3) and ( 4) and the labor market equilibrium condition, N A + N M = N , we have the equilibrium wage rate and the equilibrium distribution of workers between the two sectors {w * , N * A , N * M }, as functions of the parameters {L(R), K, pA , pM }. The equilibrium urbanization rate is given by U ≡ N * M / N . In order to analyze the impact of rainfall on urbanization, we first have to determine the rate of changes in agricultural and manufacturing employment\\ndN A N A = RL (R) L(R) η L(R) dR R - 1 1 -α A dw w , (5\\n)\\ndN M N M = - 1 1 -α M dw w . (6\\n)\\nTaking the rate of change in the labor market equilibrium condition, we have\\n(1 -U) dN A N A + U dN M N M = 0,(7)\\nwhere we abstract from the growth in the labor force. From Eqs. ( 5), (6), and ( 7), we derive the following proposition.',\n",
       "  'Proposition. A decline in rainfall raises the urbanization rate. Specifically, the elasticity of the urbanization rate with respect to rainfall is given by': '∂ ln U ∂ ln R = ∂ ln N M ∂ ln R = - η L(R) U 1-U + 1-α M 1-α A < 0. (8\\n)\\nThe impact of a change in rainfall can in fact be assimilated to the change in factor endowment à la Rybczynski showing how changes in an endowment affect sectoral outputs. Here a similar effect can help to better understand the linkages between changes in productivity of the input specific to agriculture (i.e. land) through changes in rainfall and changes in the urbanization rate through change in the relative share of manufacturing versus agriculture employment. 5',\n",
       "  'The rainfall dependence of sub-Saharan African agriculture': \"The dependence of sub-Saharan African (henceforth SSA) agriculture on rainfall and its implications for Africa's economic development has been widely documented in the literature. The present section summarizes this literature and more extended discussion can be found, for instance in Barrios et al. [2] and IPCC [15]. Changes in rainfall can potentially have a wide array of economic implications anywhere in the developing world given that rainfall is the main driver of water balance variability both over space and time. Historically, however, shortages in rainfall in Africa seem to have been associated with particularly damaging consequences, in the most extreme cases causing food and water deficiencies and the death and displacement of substantial shares of population. Part of the reason of why shortages in rainfall have been important for Africa is certainly due to the importance of the agricultural sector in its economies. Table 1 shows, for example, that agriculture has traditionally had a higher share in GDP in Africa than in any other developing regions-nearly 40 percent in 1960. Although this share has since been steadily decreasing, it still represents almost a third of total GDP in 1997, compared to the average 14.1 per cent in the rest of the developing world. In particular, African agriculture relies heavily on rainfall for the provision of water for crops. Indeed, compared to other developing areas in the world, a much smaller proportion of cropland is irrigated. More generally speaking, the geographic and climatic conditions specific to the African continent explain to a great extent why agriculture in SSA is so vulnerable to water shortages.\\nGenerally speaking, agriculture in the African tropical area is seriously hampered by high temperature, fragile soils, and low yield potential. It also suffers from chronic diseases affecting both animal and non-animal production. Outside its equatorial area, a large share of Africa's arable land suffers from aridity, tending to increase the risk of drought as drier soil absorbs more rainfall; see Bloom and Sachs [6]. 6 The vulnerability to rainfall in the arid and semiarid areas of the continent also translates into a poor capacity of most African soils to retain moisture. Furthermore, evapotranspiration is in turn relatively high in Africa, as a consequence of high temperature throughout the year, thus leaving low quantities of water for soil moisture. 7 The reduction of vegetative cover experienced by Africa over the past decades has also added to the insufficient inter-annual soil water storage; see UNEP [33]. Land-surface and atmosphere conditions may thus interact positively as a feedback mechanism leading to a further decrease in precipitation.\\nAgricultural practices often add to the water shortage problem in Africa more than anywhere else due to differences in property rights. More precisely, because farmers are often not owners of the land they work on, the preservation of natural resources is often viewed as a secondary objective. In addition, pressures represented by increasing populations and changing technology add to the problem of land deterioration related to agricultural practices; see, for example, Drechsel et al. [9]. Problems associated with land use through, for example, deforestation, can translate into increased erosion. Another illustration of environment-damaging agricultural practices is the intense use of fertilizer in low-quality lands. As yields increase, so will water consumption, thus creating a vicious cycle; see Gommes and Petrassi [12]. This causes greater exposure to desertification with the shortages in rainfall directly influencing agricultural productivity. Human practices can also add to the desertification risks through overgrazing, which is represented by higher density and/or shorter rotations of livestock beyond the limit of the ecosystem, in particular because range-fed livestock are usually concentrated in the arid and semi-arid areas since tropical areas provide potentially more exposure to animal diseases; see IPCC [15].\\nThis high vulnerability of agriculture on climatic conditions in turn opens the door to the possibility of large-scale migrations of those whose livelihood essentially depends on rain-fed agriculture, the so-called environmental migrants that have partly converged to cities. As a matter of fact, in SSA countries, urban growth has essentially been achieved through in-migration of agricultural populations, where nearly half of Africa's urbanization in the last decades has been achieved by rural-urban migration, although there have been large variations across countries (Kelley [18]).\",\n",
       "  'Data and summary statistics': 'As is standard in recent studies of urbanization and urban concentration, the data set underlying our econometric analysis consists of five-year interval observations to avoid issues related to temporal dependence. Given the missing values for some countries and some time periods, the nature of our data consists of an unbalanced panel, covering 78 countries and spanning over a 30-year period (1960-1990).',\n",
       "  'Rainfall data': 'The basic hypothesis of the paper poses that climatic conditions push people out of rural/agricultural areas to urban areas. 8 Our measure of climatic condition will be the rainfall level in a country and is taken from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data set, which provides, amongst other things, time series data on the average annual rainfall for 289 \"countries\" (comprised of 188 states and 101 islands and territories) from 1901 to 1998; see Mitchell et al. [24] for a complete description of the data set. These rainfall series were constructed by assimilating measurements of rainfall from meteorological stations across the world into 0.5 degree latitude by 0.5 degree longitude grids covering the land surface of the earth. Each grid-box was then assigned to the appropriate country in order to calculate a measure of rainfall for each by using the weighted mean of the values of all grid boxes within a country. 9 This procedure resulted in comparable mean measures, given in millimeters per square meters, of annual rainfall for each country. For the purposes of this paper we use observations on developing countries, where we consider a country to be of developing status if it is either a low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income nation according to the World Bank 2001 definition. All countries used in any part of our empirical analysis are listed in Appendix Table A.\\nThere are a number of issues to be noted in terms of constructing and using the cross-country measure of annual rainfall. First, we chose to normalize the rainfall measure provided in the data set by the long-term mean annual rainfall in each country. This was primarily done because we are interested in climatic changes, rather than permanent cross-country climatic differences in levels. In order to avoid any concerns regarding the exogeneity of this normalization factor we used the mean of the annual rainfall for the period prior to 1960, although using the long-term mean over the entire available period produced very similar results. 10 One should note that a similar measure is also used by the FAO; see Gommes and Petrassi [12]. Since our econometric analysis focuses on the effect of rainfall on long-term, five-year, intervals, we calculated the simple arithmetic mean of the annual normalized rainfall measure over the appropriate five-year intervals.\\nOne other aspect with regard to our rainfall measure that deserves discussion, because it has plagued many studies examining other potential determinants of Africa\\'s poor growth performance, is the question of its exogeneity. In terms of rainfall we can argue fairly confidently that it is a strictly exogenous factor given that it measures an aspect of climatic change. While one could in theory also hypothesize that perhaps economic activity affects such aspects as environmental degradation and desertification, and thereby possibly rainfall, Nicholson [27] finds no evidence suggesting such. As a matter of fact, earlier historical data suggests that rainfall naturally moves through long cycles of relative troughs and peaks, and that a cycle similar to the present one seems to have occurred in the 19th century; see Nicholson [28].\\nFinally, one should note that our measure of rainfall only offers a countrywide measure of precipitation. Clearly, however, particularly in large countries there may be considerable variation even within national boundaries and constraints on growth may thus be due to logistical problems of redistribution. Given the lack of data, we unfortunately have to abstract from any intra-country climatic variation. Having said this, one must remark that first this problem is partly tackled by using a fixed effect estimator, purging out time invariant unobservable covariates, which is likely to be a characteristic common to measurement errors in rainfall. 11 Furthermore, issues related to the aggregation of variables at the macro level are inherent of all cross-country empirical analysis.\\nFigure 1 depicts the long-term trends in our normalized rainfall measure for SSA countries. As can be seen, while variable, the mean rainfall in SSA countries remained roughly constant during the first part of the 20th century until the 1950s, peaking in the late 1950s. However, 9 Where a grid box was located across more than one country, the grid box was assigned to the country with the largest stake, except where a country would otherwise have been left without any grid box. Weighting was essential since the spatial areas represented by each grid box differ in latitude. For further details; see Mitchell et al. [24]. 10 Details are available from the authors. 11 In a recent study, Miguel et al. [22] similarly use a country-level rainfall-variation measure in order to instrument growth in African countries.  since this peak, rainfall has been on a clear downward trend. As a matter of fact, apart from a peak in 1980, mean rainfall has been for the most part lower than during the first 60 years of the century. These trends suggest that there has been an important climatic change in SSA since about roughly the late 1970s. Figure 2 shows, in contrast, that average annual rainfall in nonsub-Saharan developing countries displays no such trend.',\n",
       "  'Urbanization': \"Our source to construct the urbanization data stems from the UN World Urbanization Prospects [32], where urbanization is defined as the share of population living in cities to total population living in the country, and for which information is given over 5-year periods. Definitions of urbanization are those used by national statistics offices based on their latest census data. Thus, different countries having different definitions of cities, our measure of urbanization is not consistent across countries. 12 One has, however, to note that data from the World Urbanization Prospects is adjusted, whenever possible, when there are definitional changes between two censuses in a country. Consequently, one can confidently consider that definitional differences of urbanization across countries are time invariant, and thus absorbed by the fixed effect.\\nFigures from the UN World Urbanization Prospects reveal that urbanization growth rates in SSA countries have been steadily above those of the rest of the developing world over the past half century. For example, in 2000 Africa's share of urban to total population reached 37 percent (UN [32]), driven by an average annual growth rate of the urban population share of 4.4 percent between 1950 to 2000. In comparison the rest of the developing world experienced average annual growth rates of urbanization in the order of only 2.5 percent over the same period.\",\n",
       "  'Other data': \"In terms of controlling for other potential determinants of urbanization in our econometric modeling we chose a set of covariates that are standard in the literature studying the determinants of urbanization (Ades and Glaeser [1], Brueckner [7], Davis and Henderson [8], Gugler [13], among others). First, we use the size of a country's population and this measure interacted with land area since for a given population, a larger land area reduces population density, and thus influences transport within the country, which in turn might impact on urbanization through standard forward/backward linkages (Krugman and Livas Elizondo [19]). Information measuring these two variables is derived from the Penn World Tables (PWT) and the World Development Indicators (WDI), respectively. It has also been argued that openness to international markets is intrinsically linked to urbanization as countries with higher shares of trade in GDP rarely have their population concentrated in a single city. The rationale for this is that, given imported goods are not cheaper in large cities, consumers spread over space to save on congestion costs (Ades and Glaeser [1]). We thus also control for openness using the measure contained in the PWT.\\nIn the endogenous growth literature, a close connection between urbanization and national economic growth has been recognized; see, for instance, Lucas [20]. Although the causality has been subject of intense debates, it is a well-admitted fact that sustained economic growth has always been accompanied by urbanization. In their panel data study, McCoskey and Kao [21] have for instance shown that a long run relationship between urbanization, output per worker and capital per worker cannot be rejected on a sample of 30 developing countries. We thus add a measure of GDP/capita as a control regressor in our specification.\\nMore recently, it has also been shown that civil wars within a country and bordering countries can influence differences in rates of economic development across countries (Murdoch and Sandler [25]), and that during periods of armed conflicts one can usually observe increases in urban immigration because people often seek safety and try to escape famines in well-supplied urban areas (Berhanu and White [5]). As a proxy for this we use the civil war variable constructed by Murdoch and Sandler [25], which is measured as the number of years of civil wars in a country. Furthermore, Barro [3] has shown that there is a negative link between urbanization and democracy. Non-democratic institutions may disfavor urbanization on the ground that cities make it easier for people to meet and communicate. As Weber [35] already noted, city air makes one free. Conversely, assembling people makes it easier for an autocrat to monitor and control the people, and as a corollary, more democratic institutions would then facilitate displacement of people through migrations, among others rural-urban migrations. To account for this, we use the democracy variable from the POLITY database, which ranges from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and measures general openness of political institutions.\\nFinally, during periods of colonization there notably were restrictions on intra-national movements of population, especially for African natives, in certain regions of Africa. Thus, in order to take account of this we use a decolonization indicator variable, equal to 0 when countries were colonized and 1 otherwise. The information on the date of decolonization has been taken from the CIA factbook. 13   \",\n",
       "  'Summary statistics': 'Using available data on rainfall and the other control variables listed above left us with a sample of 78 developing countries, of which 36 are SSA and the remainder are nonsub-Saharan African (henceforth NSSA), for five-year periods over the years . One should note that because even within this common time period of all our main variables used in our analysis there was not data available for all countries in any given five year segment and hence that our panel data set is of an unbalanced nature.\\nSummary statistics of all our explanatory variables across the two groups are given in Table 2. Accordingly, one finds, as would be expected, that urbanization is lower in SSA than elsewhere. One should also note that normalized rainfall is lower, compared to rainfall figures in NSSA nations. In terms of the other variables, one discovers that SSA countries are poorer, but have greater openness. Also, while they are less democratic, they have nevertheless experienced less civil wars. Moreover, the summary statistics on population size and land area suggest that African countries are much less populated and have lower population densities on average. Finally, during our sample period there were more periods of colonization in SSA than in NSSA countries.  13 For details: see: http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/.',\n",
       "  'Econometric results': \"In order to validate the basic hypothesis of the paper, we run parametric estimations examining the determinants, including climatic change, of urbanization. In particular, we estimate\\nU it = α + βX it + δR it + λ t + μ i + ε it , (9\\n)\\nwhere U is the log of urbanization rate, defined as the share of urban to total population, R is our primary explanatory variable, i.e., log of rainfall, X is a vector of other time varying potential determinants, λ are year specific effects common to all countries, μ are time invariant country specific effects possibly correlated with other explanatory variables, and ε is the usual error term.\\nIn order to purge the effects of μ, i.e., all time invariant determinants, from (9) we, as is common in cross-country studies with time dimension, use a fixed effects estimator.\\nOur results of estimating ( 9), first without including our proxy for climatic change, are shown in the first column of Table 3. As can be seen, only openness and democracy play significant roles in determining the rate of urbanization. In this regard, one should note that openness is in line with a priori expectation, i.e., economies that are more open also have higher rates of urbanization, while democracy encourages lower urbanization. In the second column of the same table we subsequently included our measure of climatic change, i.e., rainfall. The negative and highly significant coefficient on this proxy provides strong support for our main hypothesis embodied in (9), where, accordingly, decreases in rainfall encourage migration to urban areas. The size of the coefficient suggests that a one-percent fall in normalized precipitation induces urbanization to rise by 0.45 percent.\\nIn order to investigate whether the negative relationship between urbanization and rainfall is different across SSA and NSSA nations as we argued in Section 3, we interacted our rainfall measure with a SSA dummy, as shown in the third column of Table 3, thus using the NSSA countries as a control group. The fact that this renders rainfall on its own insignificant, but produces a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction terms, suggests that on average there has only been an effect of rainfall on urbanization in SSA countries. This result can be explained, as suggested in Section 3, by the very different geographic, cultural features and also agriculture practices specific to SSA. One may also want to note that the coefficient on the interaction term is substantially larger than that found on rainfall on its own in the specification without the interaction term. As a robustness check we also separated out our total sample into SSA and NSSA sub-samples and reran (9) for these separately, results of which can be found in the fourth (SSA sample) and fifth (NSSA sample) columns of Table 3. Importantly, this allows both coefficients and the error generating process to be different across these country groups. As can be seen, this qualitatively confirms our results for the pooled sample-rainfall only has a significant effect for the SSA group although one may want to view the results with some caution since, particularly for SSA, it restricts sample size considerably.\\nOne potentially important aspect neglected thus far is that, during colonial times, native Africans were often forbidden to live permanently in cities of eastern and southern Africa (O'Connor [29]). More precisely, during the colonial period, certain laws kept most Africans from residing in the white European cities in many areas of Africa. Partly as a consequence of this, in the 1950s, Africa was the least urbanized region of the world, with roughly 15 percent of its inhabitants living in urban centers, compared to figures above 30 per cent in the rest of the developing world and around 60 percent in the developed countries. These strict prohibitions disappeared after independence except in South Africa. 14 Thus, when the African colonies obtained their independence, migration to cities increased sharply, changing the racial composition of cities and leading to rapidly mounting urban populations. Following a catch up movement, urbanization accelerated rapidly after independence with mass movement of population away from the rapidly deteriorating agricultural sector and the fall in world raw commodity prices in the early 1980s (Miller and Singh [23]). 14 The case of South Africa is of particular interest. It gained its independence in 1910, but segregation laws continued to persist, especially after the adoption of the policy of apartheid in 1948. During the 19th century, separate villages for African and colored people were established in the smaller towns. Official segregative tendencies were given a boost by the outbreak of bubonic plague in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth in 1901, with the establishment of new state-controlled African locations several kilometers from the centers of the two cities (Swanson [30]). This in turn drastically limited the pace of urbanization in South Africa.\\nGiven that part of the time series used here captures times of decolonization, particularly in SSA, we have further investigated the possibility that rainfall's impact on urbanization in SSA countries may have changed for some countries in our estimations. In order to do so, we have interacted a decolonization dummy jointly with the SSA dummy and the rainfall variable in the last column of Table 3. Moreover, in order to ensure that we are not just capturing other factors that altered with colonial independence, we also appropriately included the dummy on its own, its interaction with rainfall, and its interaction with the SSA dummy. Firstly, the coefficient of the interaction term with the SSA dummy suggests that urbanization in SSA increased significantly after countries became independent as one would naturally expect following the discussion above. More importantly, however, while the coefficient on the interaction term between the SSA dummy and rainfall remains negative and statistically highly significant, the coefficient on the interaction term of the decolonization dummy, the SSA dummy, and rainfall also displays a statistically significant negative coefficient. This implies that in times of independence, rainfall has had a reinforced impact on internal migration towards cities. This result, in turn, is consistent with the argument according to which decolonization has allowed greater internal movement of individuals, in response to climatic conditions.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'In this paper we have examined whether climatic change in terms of decreasing trends in rainfall may provide some explanation towards the very different urbanization patterns that have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa compared to other developing countries over the last several decades. Our analysis suggests that indeed this has been the case. Specifically, we find that while shortages in rainfall have acted to increase rates of urbanization on the sub-Saharan African continent, there is no evidence of such for the rest of the developing world. Moreover, our analysis suggests that this link was reinforced after colonial independence of sub-Saharan African countries, which often resulted in the simultaneous lifting of legislation prohibiting the free internal movement of native Africans.'},\n",
       " 1: {'abstract': 'Migration-environment models tend to be aspatial within chosen study regions, although associations between temporary outmigration and environmental explanatory variables likely vary across the study space. This research extends current approaches by developing migration models considering spatial non-stationarity and temporal variation e through examination of the migration-environment association at nested geographic scales (i.e. whole-population, village, and subvillage) within a specific study site. Demographic survey data from rural South Africa, combined with indicators of natural resource availability from satellite imagery, are employed in a nested modeling approach that brings out distinct patterns of spatial variation in model associations derived at finer geographic scales. Given recent heightened public and policy concern with the human migratory implications of climate change, we argue that consideration of spatial variability adds important nuance to scientific understanding of the migration-environment association.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"Fueled by recognition of the world's changing climate (IPCC, 2007(IPCC, , 2012)), the past several years have seen burgeoning academic interest in the environmental dimensions of human migration. The connection is logical, particularly in rural regions where daily lives are dependent on proximate natural resources, since environmental change portends dramatic shifts in livelihood options. In the face of livelihood decline, migration can be seen as an adaptive strategy (McLeman & Hunter, 2010) and, therefore, methodological advancements in the study of migrationenvironment associations are particularly timely.\\nThis paper offers substantial methodological advancement in this context through systematic examination of the robustness of migration-environment associations across different spatial scales (whole-population, village, and subvillage). Since migrationenvironment associations are expected to vary under different socio-ecological conditions, models not accounting for such variations (i.e. 'global' statistical models) are limited in that they provide only an averaged estimation of this association across a predefined space. How to methodologically assess the robustness of such associations across different scales, and to explore the effects of inherent spatial variation of such associations with statistical rigor, remain open questions. We explore these questions here.\",\n",
       "  'Environmental dependence in rural regions': 'Recent studies document widespread use of natural resources and natural resource-based products in rural regions across the globe. Millions of households make direct use of wild resources for dietary and other household uses (Crookes, 2003), while some engage in direct trade of collected products such as fruit, mushrooms, worms (e.g. Wynberg et al., 2003). Resource-based craft trades are also common, for example producing and selling twig brooms and reed mats, represent important livelihood strategies in parts of rural South Africa (Botha, Witkowski, & Shackleton, 2004;Gyan & Shackleton, 2005;Shackleton, Campbell, Lotz-Sisitka, & Shackleton, 2008). Although cash returns to resource-based livelihoods are often quite low, many households devote time and energy to these activities to enhance livelihood security and lessen the need to seek demoralizing, insecure casual labor (Shackleton & Shackleton, 2011).\\nProximate natural resources also often serve as \"safety nets\" for vulnerable rural households in less developed settings (Hunter, Twine, & Johnson, 2011;McSweeny, 2004). A recent study in rural South Africa found that, in the wake of a shock such as job loss or mortality, a majority of households increased use of locallycollected resources such as wild foods, fuelwood and medicinal plants (Paumgarten & Shackleton, 2011). In the wake of environmental change, the availability and variability of such natural \"safety nets\" may shift and households may adapt alternative strategies such as migration.',\n",
       "  'Migration as adaptation': \"Human migration as an adaptive strategy is certainly nothing new, and historical analogs, such as investigation of migration from the Great Plains' Dust Bowl, have informed recent understandings of migration potential (McLeman & Smit, 2006). Yet, what is new is the sheer number of households potentially impacted by contemporary environmental change, the magnitude of vulnerability due to widespread impoverishment, and the security concerns being articulated by policymakers and the public (Scheffran & Battaglini, 2011). Further, recent methodological advancements have provided the basis for improved scientific examination of the migrationenvironment association.\\nAspatial empirical models have taken two key forms. First, aggregated data (such as information at the state, county or village levels) are used as units of analysis in order to estimate associations between migration rates and relevant socio-economic and environmental characteristics (e.g. Feng, Krueger, & Oppenheimer, 2010;Hunter, 1998Hunter, , 2000)). Within such models, environmental factors are included as general spatially undifferentiated measures. As a logical consequence, spatial dependence and clustering effects are rarely considered, and variation in the migration-environment association within the broader study region is not explored. Second, individualand household level predictive models of migration have been extended to add environmental measures to the set of typical crosssectional predictors at the individual-level such as gender, age, and education, or at the household level, such as size and compositional indicators (Findley, 1994;Meze-Hausken, 2000). Within these 'global' statistical approaches, factors such as estimated (regional) rainfall or general undifferentiated measures of natural resource availability can represent local or even regional environmental pressures at a particular point in time, or they can be used to analyze change within a recent temporal window (e.g., Gray, 2009;Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004). As a consequence, results tend to reveal that environmental factors act in concert with other migration pressures and thus differential effects within the study region, net of incorporated controls, cannot be estimated.\",\n",
       "  'Needs in modeling migration-environment associations': \"Within the past several years, models of the migrationenvironment association in resource-dependent regions have become increasingly sophisticated through the use of, for example, longitudinal and/or multi-level models. These often integrate random effects (e.g., Barbieri & Carr, 2005;Gray, 2011;Henry et al., 2004;Yabiku, Glick, Wentz, Haas, & Zhu, 2009) and have, therefore, advanced inclusion of general spatial effects. However, rarely has spatial variation in the migration-environment association itself nor the role of scale in the modeling approach been the content of substantive query. Exploring spatial variation raises two important connotations of scale. Geographic scale refers to the spatial extent within which the phenomenon or association is being studied (Lam & Quattrochi, 1992), and analysis scale (or resolution) refers to the size of the units at which observations were recorded or aggregated (Montello, 2001). In this study we vary the geographic scale used for modeling (i.e. the population size, or n, in the statistical model) while holding the analysis scale (i.e. the household unit) fixed. This approach allows to explore how associations (regression coefficients) change at different spatial extents of analysis (whole-population, village and subvillage). We argue that much can be learned from how migration propensity varies with changing geographic scale of the modeling approach.\\nAlthough methods to investigate spatial non-stationarity are routinely employed in the field of geography, migration-environment connections have not been studied in this context. These existing approaches usually rely on local estimations such as varying coefficient models (Cleveland, Grosse, & Shyu, 1991;Hastie & Tibshirani, 1993) or geographically weighted regression (GWR) models (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, & Charlton, 1996;Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2002) which have significant limitations that result in a lack in robustness for statistical inference (O'Sullivan & Unwin, 2010). For instance, models can suffer from local over-fitting as a result of reduced degrees of freedom and the spatial weighting of observations in each local regression can lead to patterns of induced spatial heterogeneity (Cho, Lambert, & Chen, 2010). Furthermore, the instability of coefficient estimates as a function of bandwidth (Farber & Páez, 2007) and multicollinearity of the local coefficient estimates have been identified as serious hindrances with the GWR method (Griffith, 2008;Wheeler, 2007). For modeling Poisson distributed migration data, local estimation models have not been readily extended into a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework. In order to improve our ability to understand existing associations between migration and environmental factors on the household level and thus improve program and policy recommendations, these limitations must be addressed. Particularly, the sensitivity of statistical models to changes in geographic scale and the variation of target associations across space (non-stationarity) have to be evaluated. Identifying subregions experiencing heightened vulnerability to environmental change could greatly enhance targeted interventions.\\nThis research taps into the potential of spatially explicit demographic surveillance data from a remote rural region of South Africa, combined with indicators of both spatial and temporal variation in natural resource availability across the study site. We make use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from MODIS remote sensing imagery as an indicator of natural resource availability and variability.\\nAn analytical framework is developed that overcomes the above limitations by using traditional regression approaches on nested geographic scales generated by random simulation (spatial permutation). This allows for:\\n(i) comparison of models across (nested) geographic scales (i.e., whole-population, village and subvillage scales) in order to systematically examine the sensitivity of the migrationenvironment association to changing (sub)populations used for modeling; (ii) investigation of the spatial non-stationarity of migrationenvironment associations estimated on a set of subpopulations (i.e. villages) at the same geographic scale within the study site. In contrast to common local estimators, each model association is estimated from an entire subpopulation and has sufficient statistical rigor without induced effects of over-fitting or multicollinearity; (iii) comparison of models for two different points in time (2002 and 2007) in order to estimate the effect of changing environmental conditions on the migration-environment models.\",\n",
       "  'Data and data processing': 'The Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS) site is located in a rural region of northeastern South Africa (Fig. 1).1 Since 1992, the AHDSS has conducted an annual census, today encompassing 24 villages including approximately 84,000 residents and 14,000 households. The area is characterized by high population densities, high levels of poverty and long standing lack of development and access to state services.\\nOur dataset consists of 9374 households that were sampled in both 2002 and 2007 from the 21 villages. The latitude and longitude of each household has been recorded in the dataset, and thus provides the unique opportunity to undertake spatial analyses at the household level.\\nOur response variable is the number of temporary migrants, older than 15 years, at the household level. A temporary migrant is defined as a person leaving a household with a temporary intention and spending at least six months of a year away from home, although still linked to the rural household. As an independent variable, we employ an additive index of household socio-economic status (SES) that combines measures of modern assets, livestock assets and information about power supply, access to water and sanitation, and dwelling structure. Household SES was identified as an important explanatory variable for migration in our preliminary analysis as well as in recent research (e.g., Mberu, 2006).\\nIn order to incorporate an environmental independent variable, we use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to calculate a greenness metric as a surrogate for natural resource availability at the household level (Fig. 2). NDVI has been used to monitor plant growth (vigor), density of vegetation cover and biomass production (Foody et al., 2001;Wang, Rich, Price, & Kettle, 2004) and is therefore an effective indicator of the natural resources locally used in livelihood strategies (e.g. firewood, seeds, wild foods, fencing materials, etc.).\\nYearly NDVI values were calculated by taking the annual mean of 16-day composites from MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution). We took the mean of the year of analysis and the two years prior to create greenness grids for 2002 and 2007 (Fig. 2a). By including the two years prior to the outcome years, we take into account the availability of natural resources leading up to 2002 and 2007.\\nThe first time period is characterized by relatively high but slightly decreasing greenness values from 2000 to 2002 (NDVI between 0.55 and 0.49 on average); the latter period shows similar mean greenness but higher variation across the years with an increasing trend from 2005 to 2007 (NDVI between 0.45 and 0.53). Thus, on average, mean greenness values were similar in both time periods with some visible differences in the spatial distributions due to different resource availability \"histories\". Investigation into the effect of refined temporal trends in resource availability will be left to future research.\\nFrom the two greenness grids, areas within village boundaries were excluded since these are not communal lands and are therefore not used for resource collection. We next created 2000 m buffer zones around each household (top panel inset, Fig. 2b) based on the distance within which residents tend to travel to access natural resources (Fisher et al., 2011;Giannecchini, Twine, & Vogel, 2007). Finally, the sum of NDVI values within this buffer zone was calculated by household, then divided by the number of households in the buffer. The resulting metric serves as a surrogate for per household resource availability. To illustrate, the top panel inset of Fig. 2 shows the shaded within-village area on the bottom of the inset and the colored region towards the top of the buffer containing available and accessible natural resources. Fig. 2b illustrates household resource availability based on this calculation. Note that households toward village centers have lower resource availability.\\nIn addition to SES and the NDVI greenness metric, we include control variables that attained statistical significance in the analysis at the whole-population scale. The total number of independent variables was restricted in this way in order to facilitate localized analyses while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom. Control variables include household size, proportion working age male, gender and marital status of household head, mean educational level within household, and proportion household members currently working. Additional household level resource variables were not available for the current study; however, prior migration work has, indeed, demonstrated the predictive value of the household level characteristics in our model (e.g., Kok, O\\'Donovan, Bouare, & Van Zyl, 2003;Lindstrom & Ramirez, 2010;Massey, Axinn, & Ghimire, 2010;Mberu, 2006;White & Lindstrom, 2006).',\n",
       "  'Methods': 'Understanding the role of geographic scale: nested regions of varying sizes Three nested geographic scales are examined by subdividing the set of surveyed household locations. First, the migrationenvironment association is modeled for the whole population, making use of all 9374 households. Next, the model is fit to each of the 21 villages separately, and finally, spatial variation within each village is examined through random generation of spatially contiguous subvillage regions which is repeated in 1000 permutations to test the stability of subvillage model associations. This repeated random regionalization is done in order to test whether the subvillage models show more robust \"local\" target associations and thus indicate a geographic scale at which spatial nonstationarity in such associations could be reduced or even removed.\\nAs such, increasingly \"localized\" outmigration models are estimated, still based on underlying (sub-)populations of sufficient size and variability to develop relatively robust statistical models. The strength of this approach is that it fits a simple Poisson (GLM) regression model to the households of each spatially contiguous region within each village and repeats the random simulation of subvillage regions. It thus allows the use of established diagnostic techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the varianceinflation factor while objectively assessing spatial variation in the relationships of interest. The approach thus overcomes limitations of common local estimators (e.g., GWR) as described earlier and can be applied to count data.\\nNested subvillage regions were randomly generated such that they subdivide villages into smaller exclusive (non-overlapping), contiguous areas. Essentially, this technique constitutes a spatially constrained random permutation method. Our approach generates subvillage regions that contain a minimum of 47 and a maximum of 94 households in order to ensure that the smallest village is divided into two regions while all other subvillage regions cannot become larger than the smallest village. Thus villages are divided into subregions with a similar number of households (randomly varying between the two thresholds) while maintaining statistically acceptable sample sizes. Spatial contiguity in this regionalization process was achieved by randomly selecting two seed points (households) within each village. Regions were then generated by joining all remaining households with the closest seed point. This process was repeated until the size of all regions was between the two thresholds, creating the subvillage units (Fig. 3). We assessed the average model structure and performance over all 1000 regionalization runs in the subsequent modeling process. The same analysis was undertaken for 2002 and 2007 with the same simulated sets of subregions in order to ensure identical degrees of freedom for all models. This allows for comparison of significance levels and diagnostics between the two years.',\n",
       "  'Modeling, coefficient estimation and mapping': \"At each geographic scale (i.e., whole-population, village and subvillage), regressions (GLM) were fit for Poisson distributed household level temporary outmigration counts. For each model, coefficient estimates and their corresponding p-values were derived and residuals were tested for spatial autocorrelation using Global Moran's I (Moran, 1950) as well as for spatial clustering using Local Moran's I, a class of Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) (Anselin, 1995).\\nAt the subvillage scale, models were fit for random regions across the 1000 simulations and, for each subvillage model from each  simulation, the coefficient estimates and p-values were stored. Thus, for each household, coefficient estimates were stored from model runs on 1000 different configurations of random subvillage regions. Finally, we took the mean coefficient estimates for each household across all simulations and calculated the proportion of simulations where those coefficients were significant (p < 0.05). Thus, spatial distributions of varying mean model coefficients, and proportion of significant coefficients at the household level could be created based on a series of statistical subvillage models as described below.\\nAs for the mapping process, at the village scale we created maps of coefficient values and their statistical significance using village boundaries (polygon feature data). At the subvillage scale, we mapped mean coefficient estimates and the proportion of significant tests over 1000 model runs for each household location (point feature data). This mapping allowed us to visualize (1) changes in model structure across different geographic scales within the whole study area, (2) at each geographic scale, the spatial variation or spatial heterogeneity in the two target associations of interest (i.e., outmigration-SES and outmigration-NDVI), and (3) given the two time points (2002 and 2007), a temporal comparison of model coefficients and spatial distributions.\\nIn order to better understand the spatial structure of model performance, and thus to identify regions of potential clusters of under and over prediction, maps of LISA clusters (Anselin, 1995) on the model residuals were also created.\",\n",
       "  'Diagnostics for models at different geographic scales': \"Finally, the goodness-of-fit is assessed at each geographic scale using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Traditionally, AIC is used to compare models fit to the same population with different sets of predictor variables. Here, we compare the goodness-of-fit of two models with the same set of predictor variables but originally fit to different geographic scales (e.g., whole-population and village). AIC is generally calculated as:\\nAIC ¼ À2logðLÞ þ 2k (1\\n)\\nwhere L is the maximum likelihood estimate and k is the number of model parameters (Akaike, 1974). For n independent observations of a Poisson model, the log-likelihood function for the model with parameters b is:\\nlogLðbÞ ¼ X n i ¼ 1 ðy i logðm i Þ À m i Þ (2)\\nwhere m i is the fitted response value from the Poisson regression model for the observation y i (Rodríguez, 2007). As mentioned, AIC only allows a valid comparison between models when models are fit to the same population. Therefore, in order to compare the goodness-of-fit of models estimated on different geographic scales, we took the fitted response values m for the subset of observations from the coarser scale regression model which corresponded to the same observations used for fitting the finer scale regression model. For example, to compare the model for village number 1 (with 971 households) to the whole-population scale model, we took the 971 corresponding fitted values of m from the wholepopulation model and calculated the maximum likelihood estimate L. The AIC is then calculated using this value of L and compared to the AIC from the village model, computed with the traditional approach (Akaike, 1974). Decomposing the likelihood function of the coarser scale model in this way allows cross-scale comparisons of goodness-of-fit. This comparison was done between each village and the whole-population scale, and between each random subvillage region and the village scale for each of the 1000 simulations. Yet, a decrease in AIC of the more 'localized' model does not show whether the improvement (i.e., reduction in AIC) is statistically significant since the value has no intrinsic meaning (Sayyareh, Obeidi, & Bar-Hen, 2010). For this reason, we employed the Vuong likelihood ratio test (Vuong, 1989) to reliably identify where the finer scale of analysis performs more robust. Here, the comparison is between models considered overlapping i.e., (i) the two models have common distributional properties (Poisson) and (ii) neither model has a subset of parameters from the other (i.e. both models have the same independent variables) (Vuong, 1989, p. 320). In an empirical study, Genius and Strazzera (2002) showed that the Vuong test is more robust for comparing overlapping models than other tests (such as AIC or Cox test) for small sample sizes (recall that the subvillage regions have between 47 and 94 households). The Vuong test statistic for models f and g is:\\ny ¼ ffiffiffi n p LR n ð qn ; ĝn Þ ûn (3)\\nwhere LR n (q n ,g n ) is the log-likelihood ratio of the models f and g, and u n is the square root of the variance (i.e. standard deviation) of their point-wise log-likelihood ratios. That is:\\nu 2 n ¼ var log f ðy i jx i ; q n Þ gðy i jx i g n Þ(4)\\nA two-sided test is conducted where a critical value c from a standard normal distribution is selected based on the desired significance level, 0.05 in this case. If the test statistic v is greater than c, then model f performs better than model g. If v is less than Àc, then g is preferred over f. In the case that |v| c, then the two models cannot be discriminated (Vuong, 1989, p. 318).  \",\n",

       "  'Whole-population scale models': \"Whole-population scale model diagnostics indicate that both explanatory variables of interest, SES and NDVI, are highly significant in 2002 and 2007 (p < 0.01) (Table 1). At increasingly localized geographic scales, however, the estimates show increasing spatial variation and increasing variance across regions (as discussed below). This suggests that the whole-population scale obscures considerable spatial variation in these associations across the study area.\\nThe whole-population model's residuals reveal significant spatial autocorrelation based on global Moran's I (p < 0.05), suggesting a non-random error structure due to spatial dependence. In both years, significant local clusters based on LISA measures of low and high residual values are well separated from each other and do not vary considerably between 2002 and 2007 (Fig. 4). Substantively, this translates to spatially clustered over-and underpredictions, respectively, and suggests the need for approaches accounting for spatial non-stationarity to better understand the target associations.\",\n",
       "  'Village scale models': 'At the village scale, considerable variation emerged in coefficient estimates across villages, as well as interesting patterns of change between the two years (Fig. 5). The overall outmigration-SES association on the village scale was stronger in 2007 compared to 2002 and showed higher spatial variation in 2002 (i.e., more stable in the later time period) (Fig. 5a). This indicates that households with higher SES were more likely to send migrants in 2007 relative to 2002.\\nAs for the NDVI greenness metric, there are high degrees of spatial variation that result in positive and negative relationships in both years with a slight trend of decreasing coefficient values (2002e2007). As such, no generalized statement as to the migration-environment association accurately characterizes the Agincourt study site as a whole.',\n",
       "  'Subvillage scale models': 'The subvillage scale reveals more refined spatial patterns of associations (Fig. 6). Within village boundaries, considerable spatial variation exists in both SES and NDVI coefficient estimates, indicating considerable local variation in their association with outmigration not reflected by village scale models.\\nFig. 6 reveals that an increase in natural resource access is associated with greater outmigration propensity for some households while decreasing the propensity for others, even in the same village. This high degree of spatial heterogeneity might be explained by two distinct mechanisms. First, access to natural resources acts as a form of capital which allows a household to  free human capital (Aggarwal, Netanyahu, & Romano, 2001) and to engage in migration as a form of livelihood diversification (Ellis, 2000). Second, the access to natural capital provides households with employment opportunities, wealth and livelihood security, and thus, might \"serve as an amenity, discouraging outmigration\" (Gray, 2009, p. 458). Which mechanism is primarily impacting the outmigration decision is a function of a household\\'s vulnerability and adaptive capacity in times of changing environments (Meze-Hausken, 2000), which is in turn influenced by households\\' SES.\\nAt this geographic scale, only a few villages show fairly homogeneous associations within their boundaries for either of the explanatory variables. However, the mean of subvillage coefficient estimates within each village is extremely close to corresponding village scale estimates for both SES and NDVI. For instance, in 2002 the difference between the subvillage mean coefficient estimates and the corresponding village estimate was 0.07 and 0.29 for SES and NDVI, respectively.\\nThe proportion of significant coefficients (p < 0.05) over the 1000 model simulations (Fig. 7) provide additional information about the average significance of the model associations in explaining household temporary outmigration. The subvillage coefficient estimates show consistent proportions of significant models for both variables in both years. Fig. 7 illustrates clustering of significance proportions at the subvillage scale again indicating considerable variation of the observed relationships at this geographic scale.',\n",
       "  'Multiscale model diagnostics': \"The simple structure of nested Poisson models allows for the use of robust, well-established diagnostic methods and tests for goodness-of-fit for all three geographic scales. As a visual diagnostic, we plotted the temporary migration counts against the predicted values for each of the three geographic scales. This standard procedure shows a drastic improvement in prediction from the whole-population to subvillage scale (Fig. 8) substantiated by comparing the residuals' mean squared error at each scale (Table 2).\\nThe results of the AIC comparison also show consistent reduction of AIC at finer nested geographic scales for both years (Table 2). When testing for significance using the Vuong's likelihood ratio test, we found 86 and 62 percent improvements for village scale over the whole-population scale model in 2002 and 2007, respectively. The subvillage scale exhibited 44 and 43 percent mean improvements over the village scale in 2002 and 2007, respectively, and from whole-population scale to subvillage scale, improvement was 64 and 60 percent for 2002 and 2007, respectively. Maps of proportion significant improvements over the village and whole-  population scales identify where subvillage scale models better reveal the target associations (Fig. 9).\\nFinally, in order to better understand the impacts of increasingly localized, nested geographic scales on the structure of the data and subsequently on model results, two principal concerns must be addressed: (i) induced multicollinearity of the explanatory variables at finer geographic scales, and (ii) spatial autocorrelation of model residuals across geographic scales.\\nMulticollinearity can confound coefficient estimates and compromise interpretation. The variance-inflation factor (VIF) is a common diagnostic to assess multicollinearity in a dataset (Hill & Adkins, 2007). Most thresholds above which multicollinearity is considered severe vary between 4 and 10 (O'brien, 2007). In the present analyses, most subvillage models led to VIF values below 2; very few were above 4 and none above 7. The whole-population and village scales did not exhibit values above 2 (Fig. 10). Combined, the VIFs suggest multicollinearity is stable and not affecting data structure at finer geographic scales.\\nAs for the model residuals, the whole-population scale exhibits significant local spatial autocorrelation of errors (Fig. 4) consisting of a total of 663 and 644 clusters in 2002 and 2007, respectively. At the village scale, this was reduced to 624 and 618 in 2002 and 2007, respectively. The mean model residuals across all 1000 simulations at the subvillage scale exhibited 484 and 391 total clusters in 2002 and 2007, respectively (Table 2). Thus the spatial refinement actually reduces local spatial autocorrelation of the error structure.  \",\n",
       "  'Concluding remarks and outlook': 'Environmental conditions are increasingly being examined, in concert with socio-economic attributes, as potential factors shaping outmigration especially from rural, natural resource-dependent regions. Yet the effects of geographic scale of input for migration models as well as of spatial dependence and non-stationarity in corresponding associations remain hidden when using global statistical models for the whole population. The framework presented here allows examination of whether refining the geographic scale reduces effects of spatial non-stationarity in migrationenvironment associations and thus allows for more robust models to be computed. Based on the spatial permutation method, local coefficients can be estimated in a statistically robust way to identify spatial non-stationarity. This approach is built on a Poisson GLM framework (which can readily be applied to other GLM families, i.e. binomial or gamma) for local estimation which includes a suite of well-established diagnostic techniques. The strength of this approach is the development of full models with sufficient statistical power even at the subvillage geographic scale thereby allowing for reliable evaluation and interpretation of the results.\\nComparing model diagnostics such as the AIC and Vuong test across different nested geographic scales revealed that in general a finer scale model for temporary outmigration is indeed more robust and therefore captures the associations between migration and SES and NDVI more reliably. Further, quantification of the variation in our target associations across sub-populations at the same scale (e.g., across all villages) revealed that even within villages there is considerable non-stationarity in such model relationships. This spatial non-stationarity could indicate that community-level dynamics, which exist on the subvillage scale, are very important and influential for migration decisions on the household level. This also raises important questions regarding the degree of variation in migration-related associations that has to be expected within political or administrative units such as villages but is not captured when using traditional model approaches using global statistical models.\\nIn this study we show that the associations between temporary outmigration and explanatory variables, SES and NDVI, produce different but high degrees of spatial variation across the study site, illustrating the inherent complexity in the system and the need for local estimation models. Interestingly, we discovered considerable differences in resulting patterns between the two years of interest suggesting that target associations at even the finest geographic scale change under varying environmental conditions. In other words, there is indication that environmental change impacts model associations, thus suggesting that environmental variables derived at the household level are relevant in explaining temporary outmigration on all geographic scales investigated.\\nFuture research will examine interactions between socioeconomic factors and environmental measures and will also include refined NDVI-derived measures. Further analysis of data from the AHDSS Surveillance Site for additional points in time will also yield nuance in the substantive interpretation afforded by application of these methodological advancements to populationenvironmental modeling in the Agincourt study site. In addition, the extensive time series available of NDVI data from satellite imagery will provide a better understanding of the spatio-temporal migration-environment associations in resource-dependent communities.'},\n",
       " 2: {'abstract': 'It is widely accepted that environmental change can influence human migration.

       "  'Introduction': \"It is generally accepted that environmental change can influence human migration (Foresight, 2011;Adger et al., 2014); this process is called environment-induced migration. In drylands, migration is a commonly used strategy to cope with environmental change, as the natural resource basedwhich is highly susceptible to climate changedlargely determines the livelihood of rural populations. Drylands cover approximately 40% of the Earth's land surface and has more than 2 billion inhabitants, 90% of whom are located in developing countries (IIED, 2008). Today, more than half of the world's impoverished live in drylands (IIED, 2008;Safriel & Adeel, 2005). Hunger-and poverty-related vulnerability are likely to increase in drylands as a result of environmental changes such as land degradation, increasing variability of rainfall, chronic water shortage, and an increasing frequency of droughts (IIED, 2008;Sissoko, Keulen, Verhagen, Tekken, & Battaglini, 2011;van der Geest & Dietz, 2004). These environmental changes are recognized as potential drivers of out-migration and are acknowledged to contribute to the migration of large numbers of people (Foresight, 2011;IOM, 2008a).\\nSince the 1980s, after a period of neglect, the interest in migration-driving environmental factors has been growing (Piguet, 2012). Recently, an increasing number of scholars used theoretical frameworks to acknowledge the complex role that environmental change plays in migration processes (Black et al., 2011;McLeman & Smit, 2006;Perch-Nielsen, B€ attig, & Imboden, 2008). These frameworks extend beyond the simple assumption that adverse environmental conditions straightforwardly cause migration. Moreover, a growing number of case studies illustrate that migration can be a valuable climate adaptation strategy to improve livelihoods in drylands (Brockhaus, Djoudi, & Locatelli, 2013;McLeman & Hunter, 2010;McLeman & Smit, 2006;Meze-Hausken, 2000;Roncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2001;Scheffran, Marmer, & Sow, 2012). However, analytical and spatially explicit studies regarding the interaction between environmental change and human migration are relatively rare. Studies that empirically explore relationships between environmental pressure and human migration in drylands are typically restricted to particular stress factors in selected regions, for example, droughts in Ethiopia (Gray & Müller, 2012), vegetation changes in Ghana ( Van der Geest, Vrieling, & Dietz, 2010), or changes in rainfall patterns in Burkina Faso (Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004). However, there is a general paucity of integrated analyses of the interplay between multiple environmental pressures and human migration at the macro-scale. Moreover, systematic large-scale projects that employ a consistent and comparable approach at several sites are rare and meta-studies are virtually missing (Piguet, P ecoud, & de Guchteneire, 2011). In addition, there is a lack of insight regarding the mechanisms that lead to environment-induced migration. As a result, no globally consistent picture of the environmental drivers of human migration in drylands has emerged.\\nGiven the caveat that environmental factors are only one of many factors that can potentially drive migration, here we present a global-scale approach used to analyse spatial patterns of environmental drivers of human migration in drylands, and we link these drivers to observed hotspots of out-migration. To achieve this objective, we applied a cluster analysis to spatially explicit global data (Janssen, Walther, & Lüdeke, 2012). Cluster analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify observations based on their similarity. Our results reveal that environmental constraints in drylands can be grouped into eight distinct clusters, and the most distinctive indicators are related to water and land availability. These clusters can be used to better characterise regions of outmigration in drylands and to understand some of the dynamics that underlie out-migration.\",\n",
       "  'Drivers of migration': \"A broad range of terms and concepts are generally used to classify migration that results from environmental factors (IOM, 2008b). These concepts all draw on the classical migration theory of push and pull factors (Lee, 1966) by assigning relatively high importance to push factors that are linked to environmental conditions at the place of origin. However, environmental change is rarely the sole cause of out-migration, as migration usually occurs in a broader socio-economic and political context. Ifdand howdenvironmental change triggers migration can also depend on political, economic, and demographic constraints at various scales; therefore, measuring and isolating 'pure' environment-induced migration and making generalisation regarding the causes and consequences of migration is challenging (Black et al., 2011;De Haas, 2010;Richmond, 1995;Suhrke, 1993). Consequently, estimates of the current and future numbers of environmental migrants vary widely (Gemenne, 2011). Moreover, the individual's expectations with respect to the benefits of migrationdas well as the resulting financial and psychological costsdcan affect the individual's decision whether to migrate or not. Here, we focus on migration that is linked to a gradual decline in environmental conditions within the context of population growth, low agricultural productivity, poverty, and fragile ecosystems (IOM, 2008b).\\nBuilding on the work of Black et al. (2011), we distinguished the following six interrelated categories of macro-level drivers of migration in drylands: political factors, demographic factors, economic factors, social factor, environmental factors, and food security (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, in our analysis, we only account for environmental drivers, as reliable global grid cell data regarding the other categories of drivers in drylands are scarce. Political drivers of migration include governance types, conflicts, security, discrimination, and persecution as well as formalised resettlement programmes and/or policies. Economic drivers include technological development, investments, employment opportunities, income levels, and market integration. Economic and political drivers interact at various levels; for example, large-scale infrastructure programmes designed to stimulate economic development usually fall under the umbrella of national or sub-national governmentbased strategic development programmes and policies. Although economic development often attracts immigrants, it is usually impossible to attribute the resulting in-migration solely to either political or economic factors, as these factors are usually closely related. In contrast, an economic crisis can trigger political instability, thereby potentially causing a change in the political system and possible out-migration. Demographic drivers include population structure, growth, and the occurrence of diseases, all of which can depend strongly on the economic and/or political context. For example, to successfully curtail diseases such as malaria and HIV, providing health education programmes and access to medical care is essential. Typically, such programmes are part ofdor are excluded fromdthe national health policy, which illustrates the tight relationship between demographic and political drivers. Furthermore, demographic drivers can determine economic development via mechanisms such as education, labour availability, and labour force. Environmental drivers of migration include rapid-onset changes (such as floods and hurricanes) as well as slowonset changes, which include land degradation, desertification, and changes in climate variability. Both the severity and frequency of such environmental drivers are likely to be affected by global environmental change, which is considered to bedat least in partda consequence of complex socio-economic changes that have been developing for decades. Food security is closely related to the other four categories of drivers (political, demographic, economic, and environmental) and plays a central role in migration. Therefore, food security is a function of agricultural production, investments in food production technologies, infrastructure for food storage and distribution, population pressure, trade policies, food prices, and political stability. The perceived and actual differences between the place of origin and the destination with respect to one or more of the illustrated drivers can influence whether people choose to migrate or not. In addition, social factorsdincluding family obligations, culture, and access to migration networksdcan influence an individual's decision of whether or not to migrate. \",\n",
       "  'Data and methods': '',\n",
       "  'Environmental drivers': 'In our statistical analysis, we explicitly focussed on environmental drivers of migration, given the limited availability of global grid cell data regarding non-environmental drivers. We used spatially explicit information of potential environmental drivers of out-migration. Based on Fig. 1, we selected the following seven indicators (these indicators are elaborated below): annual mean precipitation, aridity, drought frequency, land degradation, soil constraints, cropland, and pasture area (Table 1).\\nIncreasing water scarcity is seen to be a major driver of migration in drylands (McLeman & Hunter, 2010;Mehta, 2007;Meze-Hausken, 2000). Water availability in drylands is determined primarily by the quantity and distribution of precipitation during the crop-growing period and by aridity. To cover the various dimensions of water availability, we included three complementary waterrelated indicators in our analysis. We used the mean annual precipitation for the year 2000 based on CRU data (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Precipitation can be used as an indicator of water supply without specifying how much of the precipitation is available for the fauna and flora. To account for the portion of precipitation that is directly available for plants only, precipitation must be corrected for evapotranspiration. This correction is usually performed by relating precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (PET) in order to derive the aridity index. For our analysis, we obtained data regarding global aridity from the CGIAR Consortium (Trabucco & Zomer, 2009), who derived aridity information by integrating monthly mean precipitation data from the CRU together with simulated PET data (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Because our goal was to focus solely on arid regions, we excluded all dry sub-humid regions (i.e. all regions with an aridity index >0.5) from our analysis. A high aridity index reflects low aridity. Together, the precipitation and aridity indicators reflect the average conditions for the year 2000. To account for long-term variability in the water supply, we calculated a drought frequency indicator for the period 1970 through 2000 to capture changes in annual precipitation variability within a given year. To calculate this indicator, we calculated annual precipitation variability using monthly precipitation data from the CRU (Mitchell & Jones, 2005). Annual precipitation variability is the degree of deviation of the annual value derived from the 31-year mean divided by the 31-year standard deviation (Marchiori, Maystadt, & Schumacher, 2012). Using annual precipitation variability, we determined whether each year was significantly drier or wetter than the other 30 years in the time period. Adding up all of the particularly dry years provided an approximation of drought frequency.\\nWorldwide, drylands comprise 44% of cultivated land and support 50% of all livestock (UNCCD, 2013). Thus, in addition to water availability, land and soil conditions essentially determine the livelihood of the local population. To represent soil constraints, we used information on soil and terrain limitations from IIASA/FAO (2012). This dataset combines information regarding soil nutrient availability, soil nutrient retention capacity, soil rooting conditions, soil oxygen availability, soil toxicities, soil salinity and sodicity conditions, and soil management constraints in a soil constraints rating. In addition to soil constraints, we also included land degradation, which is often identified as a major driver of increasing vulnerability and human migration in drylands (Grote & Warner, 2010). In addition to climate change, the principal drivers of land degradation include overgrazing, erosion, deforestation, unsustainable agricultural intensification, and urbanisation (Bowyer et al., 2009). In accordance with Bai, Conijn, Bindraban, and Rutgers (2012), we define land degradation as a disturbance-driven, longterm loss of land productivity from which the land cannot recover without assistance. Because land degradation can be measured as the change in net primary productivity (NPP) over time, we used NPP change estimates based on remote-sensing Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series as a proxy for land degradation (Conijn, Bai, Bindraban, & Rutgers, 2013). The NDVI data are based on fortnightly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements (Tucker, Pinzon, & Brown, 2004) that were aggregated to an annual scale (Bai et al., 2012).\\nTo capture land scarcity and the intensity of agricultural production in our analysis, we used the extent of cropland and pasture land from Ramankutty, Evan, Monfreda, and Foley (2008). These data reflect a complex interplay between issues related to climate, accessibility, and legislation (including property rights and land usability), which together determine whether or notdand the degree to whichda specific plot of land is used for pasture or cropping. In the subsequent analyses, we excluded all grid cells that were covered by !75% cropland and for which !75% was equipped with irrigation facilities (Siebert et al., 2005;Siebert, Hoogeveen, & Frenken, 2006). For these grid cells, we hypothesised that agricultural production is intense and therefore less vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions relative to the cropland that was included in the analysis. In total, we included approximately 17,000 grid cells with a spatial resolution of 0.5 in our analysis. Prior to our analysis we normalised all indicators to the zero to one range according to their minimum and maximum values among all grid cells to allow for comparability of indicator values (see Eq. ( 1)).\\nI x; 0 to 1 ¼ I x À I min I max À I min\\n(1) \\nI ¼ Indicator x ¼ Grid cell I x, 0 to 1 ¼ Grid cell x normalized to range 0e1 I min ¼ Minima among all grid cells I max ¼ Maxima among all grid cells',\n",
       "  'Cluster analysis': \"The goal of our study was to describe the spatial pattern of environmental migration incentives at the global level using cluster analyses. Cluster analysis is a statistical method that classifies observations into groups (so-called 'clusters') by calculating similarities amongst all observations using a measure of distance. Observations within a given cluster (intra-cluster observations) are more similar to each other than to observations in other clusters (inter-cluster observations).\\nTo perform the cluster analyses, we used the software environment R (see http://cran.r-project.org), a versatile open-source environment with extensive statistical functionality for data analysis, calculation, and graphical display. The cluster analysis was performed in two steps as described by Janssen et al. (2012) to account for (1) effects of initialisation and (2) to select the appropriate number of clusters:\\n(1) The common k-means cluster algorithm was applied to the complete indicator dataset, which consisted of the abovedescribed seven environmental indicators for all dryland grid cells (~17,000 cells). This algorithm is initialised by performing a hierarchical cluster analysis on a small random subset of this dataset comprising 300 of the ~17,000 dryland grid cells. To obtain an initial provisional impression of the effects of initialisation, this first step was performed twice by generating an extra initial random subset (comprised of 300 grid cells) and again performing hierarchical clustering on this new random subset.\\nThus, two sets of cluster centres resulted from this randomly repeated hierarchical clustering step, and each of these sets was subsequently used as a random starting point for the k-means clustering of the complete dataset. As a consequence of this approach, we generated two cluster partitions of the complete dataset; comparing this pair of partitions provided information regarding the robustness/consistency of the clustering procedure. For this pairwise comparison, the partitions were established by counting the number of grid cells that are allocated to the same cluster in each of this pair and then dividing this number by the total number of grid cells in order to obtain the consistency measure, which is a measure of reproducibility and which illustrates the inherent sensitivity of the k-means clustering for initializations.\\n(2) This pairwise comparison was performed a total of 200 times to obtain a more robust/accurate estimate of this reproducibility measure, thus providing an estimate of the average consistency as well as other key statistics (e.g. variance, quartiles, etc.). Moreover, this repetitive search produced 400 clustering partitions, each from another (random) initialization, and from these 400 partitions the partition with the lowest inner cluster variance was chosen as a candidate optimal partition. Repeated trials of this procedure rendered the same 'optimal' partition for each cluster number k considered, thus illustrating the robustness of this partition.\\nThis procedure can also be used to select the 'optimal' number of clusters (the 'optimal' k). By performing this repetitive pairwise comparison procedure using various cluster numbers k (e.g. k ¼ 2, …, k max ) and then calculating the average consistency for each k, the k-values for which the average consistency is highest will be good candidates for the optimal number of clusters.\\nCluster analyses are frequently used to map spatial patterns of specific conditions. In particular, environmental conditions are often grouped using a cluster analysis; for example, to create land cover maps based on satellite data (Kerr & Cihlar, 2003;Yang & Lo, 2002) or to map patterns of climate change (Mahlstein & Knutti, 2010). Cluster analyses can also be used to identify the spatial interactions between humans and their environment, as well as the consequences of these interactions. For example, Ellis and Ramankutty (2008), Letourneau, Verburg, and Stehfest (2012), van Asselen and Verburg (2012), and V aclavík, Lautenbach, Kuemmerle, and Seppelt (2013) used cluster analyses to map global distinct land use systems by combining environmental date with socio-economic data. In addition, Sietz, Lüdeke, and Walther (2011) and Kok et al. (2010, accepted) identified global patterns of vulnerability of both drylands and forests to environmental change by accounting for gross domestic product (GDP), infant mortality, road density, water stress, soil degradation, and natural agroconstraints. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used cluster analysis to spatially describe environmental drivers of human out-migration.\",\n",
       "  'Global hotspots of negative net-migration in drylands': 'Given the complexity of the migration processes, quantifying the number of migrants at the global level is a major challenge. The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIE-SIN) made such an attempt by mapping migration spatially explicit at the grid cell level over the entire globe (CIESIN, 2011;Sherbinin et al., 2012). Facing the absence of globally accurate migration data at subnational level the authors used indirect estimation methods combining time series of population maps with subnational data regarding birth and death rates to obtain net-migration rates. The resulting net-migration is the grid cell-specific, quantitative difference between in-migration and out-migration. Here, for the purposes of this study, we define negative net-migration as outmigration; the actual out-migration flow might be even higher if in-migration also occurs within the same period. There are a number of uncertainties related to the indirect estimation method, which are largely associated with the assumed relationship between population density and natural increase, the utilized census data, anddmost likely causing the biggest uncertaintiesdthe approach to impute rates of natural increase (CIESIN, 2011). The net-migration maps were validated in a way that the sum of netmigration at the national level equals estimates of the 2008 World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2009). In addition, for China and the US CIESIN (2011) compared the simulated netmigration results with net-migration rates from alternative county-level data and concluded a reasonably good correlation between the simulated and alternate net-migration rates. However, evaluating the subnational spatial patterns of net-migration for all countries was not possible, as true measures of net-migration were not available for comparison (CIESIN, 2011).\\nWe used the global map of negative net-migration for the period from 1990 through 2000 (Fig. 2), which we linked to the cluster results to discuss their applicability. Accordingly, we calculated the average negative net-migration per square kilometre for each cluster in order to explore cluster-specific migration patterns. Finally, we selected two hotspots of negative net-migration and discuss the most important environmental and non-environmental constraints (as determined by the published literature) in order to evaluate the identified clusters.',\n",
       "  'Results': 'Spatially, the environmental drivers of migration vary widely. To identify large-scale regions containing similar environmental drivers, we performed a cluster analysis using spatially explicit data. This analysis allowed us to identify the most pressing environmental conditions (per grid cell and region) that potentially contribute to out-migration. In doing so, we could distinguish regions that are characterised primarily by land-related drivers of out-migration from regions that are characterised primarily by water-related drivers of migration. For example, the two clusters that had the highest population densities and the largest crop land extent (namely, the \"Little water scarcity\" and \"Cropping\" clusters) had high land degradation and the lowest water scarcity among all eight clusters. We therefore argue that within these two clusters, land degradation is a stronger determinant of out-migration than water. Given their high population density and cropping activities, these clusters are particularly vulnerable to increasing land degradation and food insecurity. In contrast, water scarcity (expressed in terms of aridity, precipitation, and drought frequency) is the highest in the desert clusters (\"Desert with moderately constrained soils\" and \"Desert with highly constrained soils\"). Viewing these two clusters in the context of potential absolute migration flows may not be particularly relevant, given the low population density and nomadic culture typical of desert regions.\\nOn the other hand, the interaction of socio-political and environmental factors in migration processes in these two clusters is significant. For example, in Northern Mali the advance of extremist Muslim groups and Al-Qaida recently triggered migration of people both internally in Mali and to neighbouring countries. Particularly in Mali, the displaced civilians are distributed across arid areas contributing to food insecurity and tensions among the various communities, which potentially triggers new migration flows (UNHCR, 2014). This example emphasises the important role that socio-political factorsdthrough their interplay with environmental factorsdplay in influencing migration. Given the relatively high frequency of political upheaval in drylands (particularly in Africa), there might be a correlation between fragile environmental conditions, the specific demographic profile and the relatively low level of government involvement in these areas that results from these environmental and demographic conditions.\\nWe found that in particular regions, a specific combination of environmental factors goes hand-in-hand with a high rate of negative net-migration. For example, our results suggest that both high absolute and high relative rates of negative net-migration occur most often in the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster that covers the southern regions of the Sahel, the more semi-arid regions of Southern Africa, Northeast Brazil, and the Argentinian and Paraguayan pampas. This cluster is therefore more prone to outmigration than other clusters. However, identifying the extent to which the observed negative net-migration can be related directly to cluster-specific environmental constraints is difficult, as the applied migration data do not specify the reasons for migration. Other factors (including non-environmental factors) that were not considered in our analysis have likely triggered migration as well. Our findings are further supported by the results of the hotspot analyses, which illustrate the complexity of environmental and non-environmental factors in migration processes. Given the combination of high negative net-migration rates together with the identified environmental constraints, we argue that the most pressing environmental factors driving this clusterdincluding land degradationdhave contributed to the observed out-migration in the respective regions.',\n",
       "  'Spatial patterns of environmental incentives for human migration': 'The presented clusters (see Fig. 3) are a spatial expression of the environmental stressors that potentially cause migration as identified and highlighted by numerous case studies and reports. The cluster algorithm revealed that the optimal cluster number is eight, which provides the most robust results in terms of high average consistency measure. The variability of the indicator values for each cluster is illustrated in Fig. 4.\\nWe identified two desert clusters extending from the Sahara to the Arabian Peninsula and Central Asia. Both of these clusters have high aridity, low precipitation, and the highest drought frequency amongst all clusters. Cropping and grazing are relatively low in both clusters, reflecting the regions\\' harsh environmental conditions. Nevertheless, soil constraints vary between these clusters. The \"Desert with highly constrained soils\" cluster has more severe soil constraints than the \"Desert with moderately constrained soils\" cluster and represents the interior of deserts.\\nAmong all of the eight clusters, the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster has the least water scarcity. Precipitation is the highest in the \"Little water scarcity\" cluster, whereas aridity and drought frequency are amongst the lowest. Both cropping and grazing are practiced, with grassland having a larger extent than cropland. The \"Little water scarcity\" cluster is characterised by land degradation. This cluster primarily occurs at the South of the Sahel towards the more semihumid regions, Northeast Brazil and along the Argentinian and Paraguayan pampas. The \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster is a grazing cluster that is widely distributed but primarily occurs in Central Asia, Eastern Australia, South of Argentina, and the Sahara. Water resources are relatively scarce in this cluster, and this scarcity is reflected by high aridity and low precipitation. Unlike all other clusters that include cropping and grazing activities, land degradation is largely absent in this cluster.\\nThe \"Grazing under low soil constraints\" cluster is characterised by high levels of grazing activities and low levels of cropping activities. Environmental constraints can be attributed primarily to land characteristics rather than to water availability. This cluster includes vast regions in Central Asiadincluding Mongolia, Chinadas well as Australia and Eastern Africa. The \"Grazing under medium soil constraints\" cluster is similar, except that soil conditions are a more severe constraint. This cluster typically occurs in Central Asia and the United States. The \"Moderate soil and water constraints\" cluster has medium environmental constraints, with land degradation being a higher environmental stressor than the remaining seven stressors. Together with the relatively poor soils conditions, land degradation is also reflected in the limited availability of cropland. In terms of geographic coverage, this cluster is relatively small, with exemplary locations in the Andes, Botswana, Mexico, Central and Western Australia. The cluster with the best environmental conditions is the \"Cropping\" cluster, which has the most abundant water and land resources. The cropping cluster includes the largest amount of cropland, even given the high land degradation that occurs in this cluster. This cluster is one of the smallest clusters and occurs primarily in the United States, India, the Mediterranean region, and the border region between Kazakhstan and Russia.\\nAs Fig. 4 shows, the clusters do not necessarily differ from each other in all dimensions but may overlap in some. For example, there is a group of clusters that all show high levels of land degradation, such as the clusters \"Little water scarcity\", \"Grazing under medium soil constraints\", and \"Cropping\", but differ significantly in pasture and crop area. This points at differences, among others, in the quality and management of natural resources.',\n",
       "  'Linking the patterns of environmental drivers with observed hotspots of negative net-migration': 'Table 2 shows the mean values for population density, density of negative net-migration and standard deviation (SD), and the share of migrants from the total population for each cluster. Clearly, population density and absolute migrant density vary considerably between the clusters. The absolute numbers of negative netmigration are particularly high in the clusters \"Little water scarcity\" and \"Cropping\", which is not surprising given that these clusters have the highest population density. Moreover, these two clustersdand therefore regionsdare easier to access, as they are better connected in terms of transport and infrastructure. These clusters cover wide areas in southern Sahel, the Andes, and Northeast Brazil (\"Little water scarcity\"), as well as India, East China, and Turkey (\"Cropping\"). In turn, the two clusters with the lowest population densities (i.e. the two desert clusters) have the lowest absolute numbers of negative net-migration. While the relationship between population density and absolute migration numbers is rather linear across all clusters the relationship between population density and relative numbers of negative net-migrants (i.e. the proportion of negative net-migrants from the entire population) per cluster is non-linear (see Fig. 5). For example, the cluster \"Cropping\"dthe cluster with both the highest population density and absolute migration numbersdhad the lowest proportion of migrants amongst all of the clusters. In the two sparsely populated desert clusters, high relative negative net-migration was related to various factors. For example, whereas environmental factors contribute primarily to migration in Mauritania, political and economic factors contribute primarily to migration in Somalia. Furthermore, these societiesddesert nomadsdhave typically been characterised by high mobility, given their way of life. Interestingly, the cluster \"Little water scarcity\" had the second highest absolute migration numbers and one of the highest proportions of migrants amongst all of the clusters, and we can conclude that this cluster is more prone to migration than the other clusters.\\nBased on Fig. 2, we selected two hotspots of negative netmigration: Burkina Faso and Northeast Brazil. We have chosen these hotspots since 1) they are characterized by high negative netmigration, 2) published literature is available on environmental constraints and how they contribute to outmigration in these regions, and 3) they represent regions with different political, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds which allows us to hint at the global variety of environment-related migration processes in drylands. Here, we describe for both hotspots the most important environmental constraints and discuss whether dand howdthese constraints trigger out-migration. We will use case studies based on published literature to evaluate the identified clusters.',\n",
       "  'Hotspot 1: Burkina Faso': 'From 1990 to 2000, the population of Burkina Faso increased rapidly from 9.3 million to 12.3 million and is expected to continue increasing (United Nations, 2010). This population explosion resulted in increased land pressure, which in turn triggered an overexploitation of land resources, for example by reducing fallow periods and increasing the number of livestock. The consequences are the subject of debate; whereas Rochette (1990) argues that pressure on land resources caused land degradation, Gray (1999) emphasises the scale-dependency of land degradation and concludes that land degradation in Burkina Faso can only be confirmed on a large scale but not at the field scale. In our cluster results, the cluster \"Little water scarcity\"dthe highest occurring cluster in Burkina Fasodwas characterised by land degradation. As a result of soil degradation, the smallholder and pastoralist systems became more vulnerable to climate variability and other stresses, for example during the droughts in the 1970s. Land pressuredwhich is expressed in our cluster analysis as the availability of cropland and pasture landd is also reflected in the cluster \"Little water scarcity\", which contains relatively little pasture land. Although a range of soil and water conservation measures were employed (Maatman, Sawadogo, Schweigman, & Ouedraogo, 1998;Masse et al., 2011), livelihood conditions did not improve sufficiently to prevent migration. In addition, Burkina Faso has a long history of migration, and the Burkinabe are known to be highly mobile both within and across national borders (Cordell, Gregory, & Pich e, 1996;Howorth & O\\'Keefe, 1999). This migration was encouraged by the French colonial government, and after independence, migration was triggered by the rapid expansion of the economy of Côte d\\'Ivoire and cocoa production (Breusers, 1999). Thus, environmental stressors may trigger migration more strongly in Burkina Faso than in other countries, as migration networks are already in place. In contrast, the political crisis in Côte d\\'Ivoire, which was partly caused by the high rate of immigration into the country, triggered a massive wave of return migrants to Burkina Faso and caused major problems with the reinsertion of these migrants into an already overburdened land use system (Courtin, 2011). According to our cluster results, compared to regions associated with other clusters, Burkina Faso is restricted relatively little by water availability. The cluster \"Little water scarcity\" has lower aridity, fewer droughts, and higher precipitation level relatively to the remaining clusters, and land degradation is the primary constraint. In contrast, Henry, Boyle, and Lambin (2003) studied the environmentemigration relationship at the national level (rather than at the global level) and found that rainfall variability and land degradation were approximately equally strong determinants of inter-provincial migration in Burkina Faso. On a whole, we can conclude that in Burkina Faso, environmental factors such as land degradation, land pressure, and water availability are potential drivers of out-migration. Nevertheless, the strength at which these drivers operate depends on the scale of the analysis.',\n",
       "  'Hotspot 2: Northeast Brazil': 'In Northeast Brazil, smallholders are a major group for whom migration is an important livelihood strategy (Finan & Nelson, 2001;Nelson & Finan, 2009). Because they live in the poorest regions of the country, smallholders in Northeast Brazil are highly constrained with respect to their natural and technological resources (Finan & Nelson, 2001;Sietz et al., 2006). Both agricultural intensification and population growth have increased pressure on the land and triggered land degradation (Lemos, 2001). As a result  of land degradation, large areas of Northeast Brazil experienced less profitable agricultural production and a subsequent decrease in onfarm activities in the late 1990s (Sietz et al., 2006). Migrationdwith regional urban centres and more affluent Southern Brazilian or land reclamation areas in the Amazon region being common migration destinationsdis a commonly used strategy to adapt to deteriorated resources (Krol & Bronstert, 2007;Nelson & Finan, 2009). According to our cluster results, Northeast Brazil is part of the cluster \"Little water scarcity\", which is characterised by land degradation, thereby confirming the findings of the aforementioned local studies. In addition to land degradation, droughts are also an important environmental push factor. In rural Cear a, droughts have historically triggered migration; however, because the government provides food, water, and financial support to drought-affected people, drought-related migration has decreased significantly. Nevertheless, rural-urban migration remains a common livelihood strategy and strategy for coping with droughts (Nelson & Finan, 2009). However, droughts do not occur more frequently in the cluster \"Little water scarcity\" than in other clusters. From this result, we can conclude either that droughts are insufficiently represented in this cluster or that other environmental factors (such as land degradation and land pressure) are more constraining. Reuveny (2007) estimates that 8 million Brazilians have outmigrated from Northeast Brazil since the 1960s. In addition to droughts, land degradation, water scarcity, and deforestation Reuveny identified population pressure, poverty, unequal land distribution, unclear property rights, and government-subsidised settlers as primary push factors. However, ranking the importance of these factors was beyond the scope of this study. In summary, the evidence suggests that income and employment differences play a key role in explaining migration from Northeast Brazil, and these differences are determined largely by environmental change, including land degradation and drought (Barbieri et al., 2010). This illustrates the role of the environment as an indirect driver of migration and demonstrates how tightly environmental and economic factors can be intertwined, thus making it nearly impossible to attribute migration to one or both factors.',\n",
       "  'Discussion': '',\n",
       "  'Environmental versus non-environmental drivers of migration': 'Adverse environmental conditions can be either partially or completely offset by strong socio-economic and governance conditions, which inevitably raises the question of the importance of environmental factors alone when explaining the humanenvironment system. For example, Henry et al. (2003) show that migration in Burkina Faso can empirically be better explained using a combination of environmental and socio-economic factors rather than environmental factors alone. With respect to our clusters, the effect of high aridity as for example identified for the cluster \"Grazing under water constraints\" may be limited by the use of efficient irrigation facilities. However, in addition to the requirement for available water resources, farmers must also possess the knowledge and skills needed for the efficient use of irrigation water, and they must have the necessary funds to invest in an appropriate irrigation infrastructure. Another factor that can offset the effects of adverse environmental conditions on migration is the presence of alternative employment opportunities and income, for example from oil industries in North Africa and the Middle East, which may explain the relative paucity of out-migration in these regions. With respect to economic and governance conditions, considerable differences exist between regions and countries, which may improve adverse environmental conditions in some regions whilst making them worse in others. Although this integration of environmental, political, and socio-economic factors is essential for realistic future assessments of potential migration in drylands, such an assessment was beyond the scope of our study, as our goal was to provide a better representation of the environmental drivers of migration. Moreover, reliable and spatially explicit data regarding the socio-economic drivers of migration are rare, thereby hampering our ability to obtain a complete picture.',\n",
       "  'Policy implications': 'The results presented in this paper suggest cluster-specific policies to remedy observed migration patterns. Here, we illustrate possible entry points for strategic interventions for a few exemplary clusters. In the four most water limited clusters, namely the two desert clusters, the \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster, and the \"Moderate soil and water constraints\" cluster major interventions would be required to better deal with the pronounced water scarcity including measures to store and use existing water resources more efficiently and decrease water withdrawal. In many developing countries where high aridity, high drought frequency and low precipitation combines with limited institutional capacities in the water sector (ECA, 2000), low cost water-saving strategies for livestock keeping and cropping should be fostered rather than increasing water availability per se. Moreover, organising water rights can provide farmers and herders with added certainty regarding water access, and this may help reduce vulnerability due to water stress. In addition, the \"Grazing under water constraints\" cluster would additionally benefit from readjustments of grazing intensities. This may necessitate strategies for developing alternative land-independent livelihoods. In the \"Little water scarcity\" clusterd which has shown to be particularly prone to out-migrationdinterventions would particularly target land rehabilitation and improvement in land access. For example, in the rural areas of Northeast Brazil (falling into this cluster), where the majority of farmers face difficulties to make a living due to severe land degradation and poverty, interventions would focus on improving soil quality and vegetation cover based on conservation measures (Sietz, 2014). Better access to fertile land, which is largely concentrated in the hands of large-holder farmers, would further contribute to mediate the causes for out-migration due to expected positive effects on agricultural production. Given the global coverage of our study, these policy implications are necessarily broad implying the need for regional adjustments to adequately reflect specific underlying processes, social groups and implementation approaches (Birkmann, 2007). In addition, policies for better managing migration need to be integrated into the wider development strategies to be successful. This integration does not only require appropriate knowledge and resources, but furthermore strongly relies on supporting institutions, which are however frequently lacking in the climate adaptation domain (Biesbroek, Klostermann, Termeer, & Kabat, 2013). Therefore, refined policies for migration management need to be operationalised while considering the specific institutional context in the regions targeted.',\n",
       "  'Summary and conclusions': \"Migration is a widely recognised consequence of environmental change and, environment-induced migration has been given priority on international policy agendas. For example, migration has been formally introduced into the regime of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with the agreement on the Cancun Adaptation Framework at the 2010 UNFCCC COP16 meeting, which invited all interested parties to partake in 'measures to enhance understanding, co-ordination and co-operation with regard to climate-change induced displacement, migration and planned relocation, where appropriate' (UNFCCC, 2010). However, despite its clear relevance, research regarding the potential for human systemsdincluding migrationdto adapt to environmental change is less advanced than research regarding biophysical systems, ecological impacts, and the mitigation of environmental change (Wilbanks et al., 2007). Our study represents an empirical contribution to the description of environmental drivers of migration at the macro-scale. Our goal was to explore potential environmental drivers of human migration using a spatially explicit analysis and link those drivers to observed hotspots of out-migration. To achieve this goal, we performed a cluster analysis. Using the applied methodology, we identified the most severe environmental constraints in each cluster (and therefore, in each region). We show that the clustersdand the most severe environmental constraints and potential migration incentivesdcan vary widely across space. We therefore conclude that in addition to regional strategies, location-specific measures are needed to adequately address environmentally motivated migration. On the other hand, the results do not support ranking the regions based on their environmental characteristics along a gradient from low migration incentives to high migration incentives. Therefore, a spatially explicit ranking of regions based on the impact of their environmental drivers of migration is currently out of reach.\\nWe can draw several conclusions from our hotspot analysis. First, environmental factors play a major role in migration processes in Burkina Faso and Northeast Brazil. In these two regions, adverse environmental conditions likely cause a decline in the livelihood of the rural population, who usually respond with outmigration. Second, alternative income opportunities in other rural areas (Burkina Faso) or urban areas (Burkina Faso and Brazil) act as strong pull factors in combination with environmental degradation acting as a push factor. This combination of pull and push factors demonstrates the strong interdependence between environmental and economic factors, and it underscores the challenge in identifying the root cause of migration. Third, the scale of analysis likely influences the findings. The results of the global scale cluster analysis suggest that land degradation is the most severe environmental constraint for both hotspots. However, national-level analyses for Burkina Faso revealed that rainfall variability and soil degradation are approximately equally strong determinants of intra-provincial migration. With respect to Brazil, we conclude that similar differences likely exist between outcomes from the global and national scales. These findings suggest that one must select the scale of the analysis carefully based on the context of the study and the available data.\\nThe approach presented here is particularly valuable for describing environmental factors that influence migration in drylands using a spatially explicit method. However, identifying the trigger points for out-migration and quantifying actual stocks or flows of environmentally motivated migrants will require a more in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms in which socio-economic and political factors interact with environmental drivers of human migration. Consequently, the clusters identified here can be used to discuss possible migration incentivesdespecially incentives related to environmental pressuresdrather than to explain the migration dynamics themselves.\"},\n",

       "  'Introduction': \"Soil degradation, including soil erosion and nutrient depletion, is widely considered to be an important factor undermining the livelihoods of smallholder agriculturalists in the developing world (Stocking, 2003). Smallholders often lack the capital to maintain soil resources, but without external inputs the productivity of soils under continuous cultivation inevitably declines, potentially exacerbating rural poverty and creating a poverty trap (Barrett, 2008). Drawing on field measures of soil erosion and nutrient balance, soil scientists have long argued that the scope of this problem is severe (Stoorvogel and Smaling, 1990;Sanchez, 2002), particularly in the East African highlands where rural population densities are high, poverty is endemic, and access to modern agricultural inputs is poor (Pender et al., 2006).\\nMore recently, however, a collection of social scientists have challenged this interpretation on the basis of smallholder experiences and the limitations of soil studies (Scoones and Toulmin, 1998;Mortimore and Harris, 2005), arguing instead that ''soil fertility is a major constraint to production for some people in some places at some times'' (Scoones, 1997, p. 162). Perpetuating this debate is the absence of any large-scale program to monitor soil degradation (Richter, 2007), though an effort to systematically map soil types across Africa is now underway (Sanchez et al., 2009). Also lacking are studies to assess the consequences of soil degradation for social and economic outcomes beyond agricultural production, particularly at the household scale. Together these lacunae leave unclear the extent to which soil degradation undermines the well-being of smallholder households in vulnerable regions such as the East African highlands.\\nAmong potential social outcomes of soil degradation, human migration is of particular interest. A parallel debate has considered the extent to which a variety of forms of environmental change contribute to rural out-migration and population mobility. This issue rose to prominence with a widely-cited study by Myers (1997), who claimed that 25 million people were displaced by soil degradation and other forms of environmental change as of 1995. This specific claim has since largely been dismissed (Kniveton et al., 2008), but accumulating evidence of global environmental change has reinforced the salience of this issue (Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009;Warner, 2010). Only recently, however, have quantitative studies begun to address these claims by linking survey data on migration to high-resolution environmental datasets, with results that only partly support the assumption that environmental change is an important driver of migration (Henry et al., 2004;Massey et al., 2010). Very few of these studies have investigated the effects of soil quality on migration (Laurian et al., 1998;Gray, 2010), and none have used data from soil samples.\\nThis study addresses both of these debates by evaluating the effects of soil quality on internal migration from grain-producing households in highland Kenya and Uganda. These two countries Soil degradation is widely considered to be a key factor undermining agricultural livelihoods in the developing world and contributing to rural out-migration. To date, however, few quantitative studies have examined the effects of soil characteristics on human migration or other social outcomes for potentially vulnerable households. This study takes advantage of a unique longitudinal survey dataset from Kenya and Uganda containing information on household-level soil properties to investigate the effects of soil quality on population mobility. Random effects multinomial logit models are used to test for effects of soil quality on both temporary and permanent migration while accounting for a variety of potential confounders. The analysis reveals that soil quality significantly reduces migration in Kenya, particularly for temporary labor migration, but marginally increases migration in Uganda. These findings are consistent with several previous studies in showing that adverse environmental conditions tend to increase migration but not universally, contrary to common assumptions about environmentallyinduced migration.\\nß 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study takes advantage of a unique longitudinal survey dataset collected by the REPEAT project that includes data on both migration and soil properties for 1200 households (Matsumoto et al., 2006). These data are used to build a household-level measure of soil quality and individual-level measures of temporary and permanent out-migration for labor and other reasons. Random effects multinomial logit models are then used to test the effects of soil quality on migration while controlling for a variety of individual and household characteristics. The results indicate that, consistent with common assumptions, out-migration declined with soil quality in Kenya, particularly for households with small farms. However, reflecting important differences between these two countries, migration in Uganda marginally increased with soil quality, consistent instead with the existence of a poverty trap.\",\n",
       "  'Literature review': '',\n",
       "  'Soils as natural capital': \"For agricultural households, soils can be thought of as a form of natural capital that supports rural livelihoods and complements reserves of human, social and physical capitals (Ellis, 2000). Physical, chemical and biological properties of soils all contribute to their suitability for agriculture or soil quality, and these properties vary over space and time at scales that are highly salient to household decision-making (Tittonell et al., 2005;Govaerts et al., 2006). Soil quality can also serve as a key form of household wealth and is an important contributor to land value (Gardner and Barrows, 1985). Just as for other forms of capital, households can also act to both improve and degrade soil quality. Inorganic or organic inputs can be applied to maintain or improve the quality of soils under cultivation, but unchecked erosion or continuous cultivation without inputs (e.g., soil mining) will eventually undermine the quality of even highly-productive agricultural soils (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007).\\nIn many agricultural regions of the developing world, declining soil quality or soil degradation is believed to be severe and widespread (Sanchez, 2002), though these claims are not without controversy (Mortimore and Harris, 2005). A common scenario, recognized by both sides of this debate, is that farmers are aware of soil quality decline but lack the capital to invest in soil amendments. Positive feedbacks can exacerbate this process in that falling agricultural yields can undermine the household's ability to invest in inputs, leading to further declines in soil quality (Shepherd and Soule, 1998). Some studies have also found biophysical thresholds in soil quality below which it is not profitable to invest in soil amendments (Antle and Stoorvogel, 2006;Marenya and Barrett, 2009). Together these processes could theoretically lead to the formation of poverty traps from which poor households with low soil quality could not escape (Barrett, 2008), though as of yet little empirical evidence exists for this outcome. Additionally, it is important to note that the operation of these processes is likely to differ significantly from site to site given important heterogeneity in underlying biophysical, social and economic conditions (Blaikie, 1985;Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987).\",\n",
       "  'Soils and migration': \"One option for households with low soil quality is to send temporary or permanent out-migrants, a decision which can generate additional income, reduce consumption in the origin household, and diversify household livelihood strategies against the risk of agricultural failure (Stark and Bloom, 1985). This process, in which poor environmental quality leads to outmigration, is consistent with a simple push-pull model of migration (Petersen, 1958) and with the expectations of the majority of the literature on environmentally-induced migration (Myers, 1997;Laczko and Aghazarm, 2009).\\nMultiple qualitative and quantitative studies have also documented a positive relationship between soil quality decline and rural out-migration. Among qualitative and small-scale studies, Zweifler et al. (1994) observed that migration, soil degradation and land scarcity jointly increased over a period of decades in a rural highland community in the Dominican Republic. Additionally, Warren et al. (2001) documented a positive correlation between soil erosion and male out-migration for a rural community in southwest Niger. Finally, Carr (2008) found that community members in two of three regions in rural Guatemala reported soil degradation as an important underlying cause of out-migration. Among quantitative studies, Laurian et al. (1998) showed that men's out-migration declined with self-reported high soil quality in the Ecuadorian Amazon but women's migration was not affected. Henry et al. (2003), using census data from Burkina Faso and a global map of soil degradation, found that out-migration increased with soil degradation. Finally, Massey et al. (2010) used longitudinal survey data from lowland Nepal to show that migration increased with perceived declines in agricultural productivity, particularly for low-caste individuals. The latter finding is consistent with the common view that poor and marginal populations will be more severely affected by adverse environmental conditions (Wisner et al., 2004).\\nThe studies suggest that the most common relationship will be for out-migration to be higher where soil quality is poor. Nonetheless, both migration theory and a subset of previous studies indicate that the opposite effect is also possible, i.e. that out-migration might be higher where soil quality is high. The key theoretical issue is that the demands of migration, such as access to migrant networks and the cost of housing, can be high relative to household resources and thus create barriers for entry that exclude poor households from particular migration streams (White and Lindstrom, 2005). In extreme cases, a poverty trap might prevent agricultural households from both purchasing agricultural inputs and sending out-migrants. Consistent with the view are studies showing that international migrants often originate from land-rich households (VanWey, 2005;Gray, 2009). Among studies of environmentally-induced migration, Henry et al. (2004) also found that international migration of men from Burkina Faso decreased with drought, and Halliday (2006) found that international migration from El Salvador decreased following an earthquake. Particularly relevant to this study, Gray (2010) found that international migration of women from Ecuador decreased with perceived soil erosion. These studies indicate that positive effects of soil quality on migration are possible, though this has not yet been demonstrated for the case of internal migration.\",\n",
       "  'Data collection and study area': '',\n",
       "  'Data collection': 'The survey and soils data were collected as part of the REPEAT project (Research on Poverty, Environment, and Agricultural Technology) based at the National Policy Institute for Graduate Studies in Tokyo, Japan (GRIPS) (Matsumoto et al., 2006). 1 In both Kenya and Uganda, longitudinal interviews were conducted with approximately 900 households. In both cases, households were sampled from the respondents to a previous household survey, conducted by the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya and by the International Food Policy Research Institute in Uganda. The first REPEAT survey in Kenya was conducted in 2004, and 899 households were interviewed from five highland provinces (Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley, Central and Eastern) and 99 rural sublocations 2 (Yamano et al., 2005). An immediate follow-up survey was conducted in late 2004 with the same households, but data from both 2004 rounds are combined here and referred to collectively as the first round. A subsequent followup survey was conducted in 2007, and 777 households were successfully interviewed following the exclusion of 71 households from Eastern province for logistical reasons. In Uganda, the first round REPEAT survey was conducted in 2003, and 940 households were interviewed in 94 rural local councils in the Eastern, Central and Western regions (Yamano et al., 2004). The Northern region was excluded due to security issues. In 2005 a second round was conducted and 895 households were successfully re-interviewed. Rates of attrition were thus low and regression analyses of this process indicate that it was not significantly influenced by soil quality.\\nAt the time of the first-round surveys (but not the second-round surveys), soil samples were collected from grain-producing households either from the largest plot maize or another grainproducing plot if maize was not grown. Samples were collected to a depth of 20 cm from five positions in the plot and mixed. Samples were then analyzed at the World Agroforestry Center using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, a method which is particularly appropriate for large sample sizes (Matsumoto and Yamano, 2009). In this method, soil reflectance across near-infrared wavelengths is measured using a portable spectrometer. These values are then transformed into measures of soil chemical and physical properties using multivariate adaptive regression splines fit to samples which had also undergone traditional laboratory analysis. These models have R 2 values of 0.70-0.90 indicating a good fit (Shepherd and Walsh, 2002). The following soil properties were derived for each sample: percent carbon, percent nitrogen, extractable calcium, extractable potassium, extractable phosphorus, percent clay and pH. Following the exclusion of non-grain producing households and the loss of a small number of soil samples, these data are available for 682 households in Kenya and 561 households in Uganda.',\n",
       "  'Study area': \"As described above and displayed in Fig. 1, the study locations span the majority of the area of Uganda as well as the adjacent Kenyan highlands, the country's most populated region and agricultural center. This binational study area is notable for its high suitability for agriculture and dense rural populations relative to other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (Pender et al., 2006). This study locations range from 1000 to 2700 m above sea level and the climate ranges from semi-arid and subtropical to moist and temperate. The suitability of the soils for agriculture is moderate to high, and soil types include Oxisols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, and, in a few areas, Vertisols and Andisols (USDA, 2005). Smallholder agriculture is the primary land use and farm sizes are relatively small (5.6 acres on average in the study sample). Nutrient balance studies suggest that soil degradation is severe in many locations (Stoorvogel and Smaling, 1990;Nkonya et al., 2005), but farmers tend to perceive the problem as moderate (Kiome and Stocking, 1995;Adams and Watson, 2003) and some areas have notably escaped predictions of population-induced soil degradation (Tiffen et al., 1994;Carswell, 2002). Maize, beans and bananas are the primary subsistence crops, supplemented by income from cattle and milk production, cash crops such as coffee, and off-farm employment.\\nTemporary and permanent forms of migration are also important livelihood strategies in both Kenya and Uganda (Black et al., 2006). Both countries continue to be predominantly rural, and rural-rural migration is common, particularly in association with lifecourse transitions such as marriage (Black et al., 2006;Oucho, 2007). Both countries are also rapidly urbanizing, focused on the capital cities of Nairobi and Kampala, providing many opportunities for both temporary and permanent urban-bound migrants, who are disproportionately male and well-educated (Hoddinott, 1994;Agesa, 2001). Many temporary urban migrants repeatedly return to the same destination and source of employment, leaving their families in their place of origin (Bigsten, 1996;Matsumoto et al., 2006). Rates of international migration are low relative to internal migration (Black et al., 2006). Armed conflict in northern Uganda has also contributed to involuntary displacement (Vinck and Pham, 2009), but the affected areas were excluded from the REPEAT study.\\nDespite these commonalities, there are also important differences in the characteristics and contexts of the study households between Kenya and Uganda (Ehui and Pender, 2005;Pender et al., 2006). In Kenya, especially in the central highlands near Nairobi, there is good access to urban markets and agricultural inputs, and many households have successfully diversified their livelihood strategies and intensified their agricultural and animal production, resulting in significantly higher standards of living. In contrast, in most of rural Uganda access to urban markets and agricultural inputs remains poor and standards of living are significantly lower. Uganda is also considerably more diverse both in terms of ethnicity and land tenure institutions. Nearly all agricultural land in Kenya is under private tenure, but in Uganda there are at least four distinct tenure systems (customary, mailo, freehold and leasehold), reflecting the historical experiences of different regions and varying packages of rights for owners versus users (Nkonya et al., 2008).\\nThese differences are reflected in results from the first-round REPEAT surveys (Yamano et al., 2004(Yamano et al., , 2005;;Matsumoto et al., 2006; author's calculations). The consumption-based poverty rate was twice as high in Uganda (30%) as in Kenya (15%), and Ugandan homes were more often made of unimproved materials (mud walls, thatch roofs and earth floors). Ugandan adults on average also had fewer years of education (8.2) than Kenyans (5.7), and  2 Kenyan sublocations and Ugandan local councils are both small administrative units containing one or more rural villages. For simplicity they are referred to jointly as ''locations''.\\nUgandan households were more dependent on crop production, which represented 59% of their incomes. In contrast, Kenyan livelihoods were considerably more diversified, with non-farm employment, livestock, and migrant remittances providing 38%, 21% and 7% of household income respectively. Among Kenyan households, 80% used chemical fertilizers and 63% applied manure, whereas only 7% and 16% of Ugandan households used these inputs. Similarly, 68% of Kenyan cattle were from improved breeds, versus only 22% of Ugandan cattle.\\nRegarding ethnic and tenure diversity, seven ethnicities were represented among the Kenyan households and nearly half of households were Kikuyu, whereas the Ugandan households included members of 28 ethnicities with no dominant group. In Kenya, almost all agricultural plots were privately held (with 13% rented-in), whereas Ugandan plots were variously held under customary (46%) or freehold tenure (41%), will a smaller proportion under mailo tenure (13%). Consistent with evidence that all three Ugandan forms of tenure often serve as de facto individualized tenure (Nkonya et al., 2008), a majority of plot owners across all three types (64-81%) reported being able to sell their plots.\",\n",
       "  'Analysis': 'The analysis of the effects of soil quality on migration proceeded in three steps as described below. First, the soils data were used to build a household-level measure of soil quality. Second, the survey data were used to build four individual-level measures of migration, which were linked in an individual-level dataset containing potential predictors of migration. Third, random effects multinomial logit models were used to examine the influences of soil quality and other factors on migration. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.',\n",
       "  'Soil quality': 'To build a measure of soil quality, principal components analysis was used to construct an index of the seven measured soil properties. This is a common approach to reducing data dimensionality, and creates an index that maximizes the proportion of variance explained in the underlying data (Sena et al., 2002). Raw values of the seven soil measures are presented in Table 1. Consistent with previous studies, these values indicate the soils of the study area are relatively fertile overall but with considerable variability, particularly in Kenya. The values of five measures, those for carbon, nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus, were strongly right-skewed and thus were transformed by ln(x + 1) prior to the analysis to reduce the influence of outlying values. To remove any influence of the scale of measurement, all seven measures were then standardized into z-scores prior to conducting the analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that the first principal component explained 50% of the variance and the variable loadings for this component are consistent with a measure of soil quality. The loading increases with the levels of carbon, nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus and decreases with the level of clay (Table 1). The value of the first principal component was rescaled to range from 0 to 10, and this value is referred to below as the soil quality index.\\nThe soil quality index is also highly correlated with two other potential measures of soil productivity: the first principal component of the soil spectrometer readings across all wavelengths (r = 0.92), and a measure of soil organic matter which was measured using traditional laboratory techniques for the Uganda samples (r = 0.82). Both of these alternative measures have been linked to improved crop yields in previous analyses of the REPEAT data (Matsumoto et al., 2008;Yamano, 2008). These results suggest the highly-correlated soil quality index constructed here is also an appropriate measure, with the additional benefits of being available for both countries and being a transparent function of key soil properties. Robustness checks incorporating these alternative measures or equivalent indices derived separately for each country replicate the key features of the results presented below.\\nThe soil quality index has a skewed and multimodal distribution that likely reflects nonlinear soil processes and the clustering of soil properties around discrete soil types (Fig. 2). To simplify the interpretation of this measure, it is collapsed for the primary regression specification into a simple dichotomous indicator for index values greater than the global median (2.79). This indicator is referred to as high soil quality. To capture any limitations of this approach three alternative specifications are also tested: a linear specification using the raw soil quality index, a four-category indicator for the quartile of the soil quality distribution, and an equivalent dichotomous measure for soil carbon only, referred to as high soil carbon. Soil carbon is a key measure of soil quality that is particularly resistant to change over time (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007), and this measure is included to address the possibility that other measured soil properties might be responsive in the short-term to land management decisions and thus endogenous to household livelihood strategies (see Section 4.4).',\n",
       "  'Migration': 'To characterize the diversity of population mobility in the study locations, four migration outcomes were constructed by drawing on a question about migration asked in both rounds of the survey and on the longitudinal aspect of the data. In the household roster, the survey recorded the number of months that each member had lived at home in the previous 12 months, and, for those who were absent, coded the motivation for their absence. Using the firstround survey, household members who had lived in the household for 1-11 months in the previous year were defined to be temporary migrants. These were further classified into those who had departed for employment-related reasons (labor migrants) and for other reasons (non-labor migrants) to create a multinomial outcome. Non-labor migration was most commonly for schooling, marriage or to live with other family members. Then, drawing on the longitudinal aspect of the data, individuals who were resident for one or more months at baseline but were resident for zero months at follow-up were defined to be permanent migrants, and again classified as labor or non-labor migrants based on the motivation for their absence. Individuals can be both temporary and permanent migrants if they were temporarily absent in the first round and fully absent in the second round. However only one motivation was recorded for each move, thus both temporary and permanent moves were classified as either labor-related or nonlabor-related but not both. The destination of moves was not recorded, thus this definition likely includes some moves that would be excluded by a restrictive definition of migration (see Section 4.4).\\nTo analyze these outcomes, an individual-level dataset containing the migration measures was linked to the household-level measure of soil quality and several control variables, all measured in the first-round survey (Table 2). At the individual level, control variables include gender, age, relationship to the household head, marital status and years of education. At the household level these include household size, gender of the head, agricultural land area, and the value of livestock. As the latter two variables are censored at zero and right-skewed, these values were transformed by ln(x + 1) prior to inclusion, and in both cases a squared term was added to allow for nonlinear effects. Examination of Table 2 reveals that, consistent with the description above, asset values and levels of education are higher in Kenya. However, both farm and household sizes are larger in Uganda, and overall soil quality is similar.\\nTogether these controls account for the majority of important small-scale influences on migration that have been identified by previous studies (White and Lindstrom, 2005). Preliminary analyses also explored the inclusion of measures of migrant networks at the level of the household and location (i.e. sublocation/local council), which were derived from reports of departures prior to the first-round REPEAT survey. Ultimately these were excluded because (1) household-level networks might reflect the effects of past soil quality, (2) location-level networks were not well measured for small and singleton clusters, and (3) inclusion of these predictors did not substantially alter the effects of soil quality described below.\\nPreliminary regression models of the four outcomes revealed that rates of migration were very low for household heads, their spouses, and individuals under age 18 and over age 49, and they were thus excluded from the analysis as not at risk of migration. This finding and analytical approach are both consistent with previous studies (e.g., Hoddinott, 1994;Gray, 2009). Households without soils data were also excluded. The results can thus be interpreted as applying to individuals who are at risk for migration in grain-producing households. Following these exclusions, the dataset contains 1343 individuals from 518 households in Kenya and 778 individuals from 307 households in Uganda. Due to attrition and sample exclusions for the second-round surveys, the sample size for permanent migration is smaller, and includes 1013 individuals from Kenya and 654 individuals from Uganda.\\nTable 3 displays propensities of migration for the four migration streams stratified by country and by the dichotomous measure of soil quality. Chi-squared tests were used to compare migration propensities across soil quality categories, and adjusted for clustering at the level of the location. The results reveal that rates  of temporary migration are much higher in Kenya, consistent with reports in the literature (Black et al., 2006). Additionally, approximately one half of temporary migration and one third of permanent migration are motivated by the search for employment.\\nComparisons between households with high and low soil quality reveal that temporary migration and labor-motivated temporary migration in particular were significantly lower from Kenyan households with high soil quality. Thus in Kenyan households with low soil quality 29% of all individuals were temporary migrants, versus 18% in households with high soil quality (p < 0.001).\\nPermanent labor migration was also marginally lower from households with high soil quality in Kenya (p = 0.07). In contrast, permanent non-labor migration was marginally higher from households with high soil quality in Uganda (p = 0.06). These results suggest that soil quality influences migration in the study area, but the results do not account for any other individual, household or contextual characteristics that might be correlated with soil quality. These additional factors are accounted for using multivariate regression models as described below.',\n",
       "  'Regression models': 'Random effects multinomial logit models (Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) were estimated to investigate the influences of soil quality on migration while accounting for other factors. This model is appropriate for categorical outcomes and, as described below, accounts for clustering and contextual effects at the level of the household, location and region. For this model, the outcome is coded 0 for no migration, 1 for labor migration, and 2 for non-labor migration. The model is estimated separately for temporary and permanent migration in both Kenya and Uganda, i.e. four versions of the model. The model has one equation for each form of migration (labor and non-labor), with the following form:\\nlog p mi j 1 À p ni j ¼ b m0 þ b mk X mi jk þ a mr þ e m j\\nwhere p mij is the odds of migration for individual i in household j for migration stream m (labor or non-labor migration), p nij is the odds of no migration, b m0 is a stream-specific constant, b mk is a vector of parameters for the effects of the independent variables (k), X mijk is a vector of the independent variables including soil quality, e mj is a household-level random effect, and a mr is a fixed effect for the region, defined as provinces in Kenya and administrative regions in Uganda. All models are also adjusted for clustering at the level of the location (Angeles et al., 2005). For presentation, coefficients are exponentiated (e b ) to create odds ratios, which can be interpreted as the multiplicative effect of a one unit increase in the predictor on the odds of migration. Predicted probabilities of migration can also be derived from this equation. This model corrects for clustering and contextual effects at three levels: the household, the location and the region. The inclusion of household-level random effects accounts for any unobserved characteristics at the household level under the assumption that they are not correlated with the observed characteristics. The adjustment for clustering at the location level additionally corrects for any location-level correlation arising from the clustered sampling strategy. Finally, the inclusion of fixed effects at the regional level accounts for all large-scale contextual factors as long as the effects are linear. This collection of approaches thus accounts for household-level migration strategies, the clustered sampling strategy, and large-scale contextual influences on migration.\\nA supplementary set of models was also estimated to test for interactions between soil quality and the other predictors, allowing the effects of soil quality to vary between population subgroups. This analysis provides insights into which groups are most vulnerable soil quality-induced migration, but should be considered exploratory given the large number of interaction terms that were separately tested for significance.',\n",
       "  'Strengths and weaknesses of the approach': 'The methodological approach described above has several notable strengths. First, the data are derived from a large, binational household survey with a longitudinal component, a type of data that is rarely available for analyses of agriculture and migration in the developing world. Second, the data are even more exceptional for including the results of household-level soil analyses, allowing the construction of multiple measures of biophysical soil quality that do not rely on self-reporting. Third, specific survey questions on migration and the longitudinal nature of the data permit the disaggregation of four different kinds of migration, better capturing the diversity of rural population mobility than many previous studies. Fourth, the use of random effects regression allows controls for variety of potential confounders as well as corrections for contextual effects at the household, location and regional scales.\\nHowever the methodological approach also has at least two weaknesses that should be noted, one specific and one general. The specific issue is that, as mentioned above, data on the distance and destination of moves was not collected, thus it is likely that some moves were to nearby destinations and would not be considered migration under a restrictive definition. This is more likely to be the case for moves made for non-labor-related reasons, such as marriage, relative to labor-related moves which are commonly made to distant destinations (Hoddinott, 1994;Agesa, 2001). The more general issue is that the analysis does not attempt to model potential feedbacks between migration and soil quality, i.e. the possibility that soil quality is endogenous to migration. This problem could arise if past migration influenced soil quality via a loss of access to agricultural labor or the investment of migrant remittances in soil amendments (Crowley and Carter, 2000;Warren et al., 2001). To address this problem, as described above, I have included a measure of soil carbon in an alternative specification of the regression model. Soil carbon is a long-term measure of soil quality that only changes slowly under agricultural management (Kapkiyai et al., 1999;Richter et al., 2007), limiting the possibility that it could be endogenous to past migration.',\n",
       "  'Results': '',\n",
       "  'Kenya': 'The results for Kenya are presented in Table 4. First the results for the control factors and then the results for soil quality are discussed below. Overall the results of the control variables are consistent with previous studies from East Africa (Hoddinott, 1994;Bigsten, 1996;Agesa, 2001). At the individual level, women and married individuals were more likely to become non-labor migrants for both temporary and permanent moves, reflecting the role of women as the most frequent family-related movers and the ties of married individuals to multiple households. Migration was also strongly stratified by age with most moves peaking at ages 25-29, with the exception of permanent labor migration where rates were highest for ages 35-49. The effects of age were strongest for temporary labor migration, reflecting an important lifecourse dimension to this move, and weakest for temporary non-labor migration, consistent with moves to visit and assist other family members. Educated individuals were also more likely to move, particularly for temporary labor migration. Children of the head, with strong ties to the household, were more likely to make laborrelated moves and less likely to make other types of moves.\\nHousehold-level control factors were not as consistently important but also had significant effects. Non-labor migration increased with household size, likely reflecting moves to live with other family members, but labor migration was not affected. Female headship did not influence migration. The nonlinear effects of land area and livestock value were jointly significant for permanent labor migration but not other migration streams. Permanent labor migration decreased with land area but at a decreasing rate. Consistent with the complex nonlinear effects of wealth seen in previous studies (e.g., VanWey, 2005), permanent labor migration is low for households with no livestock, increases to a maximum at $75 of livestock value (the 18th percentile for Kenya) and then declines slowly. Thus land appears to act as an amenity, retaining migrants, as does livestock above a minimum value that is necessary to migrate, likely due to migration costs.\\nConsistent with the descriptive results in Table 3, soil quality had negative effects on migration that were most important for temporary labor migration. In the primary specification with the dichotomous indicator for high soil quality, the odds of temporary labor migration were 67% lower for households with high soil quality (p < 0.001) and the odds of permanent labor migration were 42% lower (p = 0.041). High soil quality was also associated with marginally lower odds of temporary non-labor migration (p = 0.098), and had a negative but non-significant effect on permanent labor migration. The negative effect on temporary labor migration was also evident in the three alternative specifications: temporary labor migration decreased with the linear quality index, was lower for the highest two quartiles of soil quality, and was also significantly lower for households with high soil carbon. Thus there is a clear negative effect of soil quality on temporary labor migration and some evidence for negative effects on other migration streams.',\n",
       "  'Uganda': 'The results for Uganda are presented in Table 5. Overall the results are not as strong as those for Kenya, reflecting the smaller sample size, but an interesting story emerges nonetheless regarding soil quality as described below. Among the control factors, gender did not have significant effects but age was again important. Temporary labor migration and permanent non-labor migration peaked at ages 25-29, permanent labor migration peaked at ages 30-34, and temporary non-labor migration was not affected, similar to the pattern for Kenya. Non-labor temporary migration was again higher for married individuals, though relationship to the head was unimportant. Permanent non-labor migration also unexpectedly decreased with education, potentially reflecting lower family-related mobility for individuals with access to skilled employment.\\nAt the household level, temporary non-labor migration and permanent labor migration both unexpectedly decreased with household size, which may reflect lower per capita resources in these households that are available to invest in migration. The nonlinear effects of land area and livestock value were jointly significant only for temporary labor migration, with a similar pattern to that of permanent labor migration in Kenya. Temporary labor migration decreased at a decreasing rate with land area, and increased rapidly with livestock value to a maximum at $20 (at the 20th percentile for Kenya) and then declined.\\nIn contrast to Kenya but consistent with the descriptive results, soil quality had marginally positive effects on migration, specifically for permanent non-labor migration. In the primary specification, the odds of permanent non-labor migration were 91% higher from households with high soil quality (p = 0.081). This effect was also evident in the linear, categorical and carbon-only specifications.',\n",
       "  'Interaction models': 'A supplementary set of exploratory models also tested for interactions between soil quality and the other predictors in all four models. Consistent with expectations, the interaction between soil quality and land area emerged as the most important interaction, and was jointly significant for the case of permanent labor migration in Kenya (p = 0.019). Given the large number of interaction coefficients that were tested for significance as part of this exploratory analysis, these results should not be considered as definitive but instead as a point of departure for future studies. To present the results of the interaction between soil quality and land area, predicted probabilities of permanent labor migration were derived for households with high and low soil quality using mean values of the other predictors from the Kenyan sample (Fig. 3). This reveals that permanent labor migration is low for households with high soil quality and low for land-rich households with low soil quality, but very high for land-poor households with low soil quality.',\n",
       "  'Discussion': \"Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that soil quality is associated with reduced migration in Kenya, particularly for temporary labor migration, and weak evidence that soil quality is associated with increased migration in Uganda, most clearly for permanent non-labor migration. The pattern in Kenya suggests that households respond to low soil quality, and consequently reduced agricultural yields, by sending temporary migrants as a way to generate additional household income. Temporary migration is a common strategy in Kenya (Table 3) that likely has low barriers to entry, potentially explaining how even households with poor soil quality can afford to participate. In contrast in Uganda, the pattern is less clear but the results suggest that low soil quality reduces households' ability to send permanent non-labor migrants for reasons such as marriage and schooling. Due to costs such as housing, school fees and bridewealth, these forms of mobility may have relatively high barriers to entry, perhaps explaining why households with poor soil quality might be excluded.  The divergent results reflect the quite different economic contexts of these two countries and reinforce Blaikie and Brookfield's (1987) claim that land degradation is always contextual. In Kenya, temporary migration is a common livelihood strategy and there are substantial opportunities for agricultural intensification and diversification (Section 3.2). In this context, households with low soil quality can afford to send migrants, with the knowledge that they will be able to profitable invest the wages on their farms. Households with small farms appear to be most affected, consistent with expectations that poor households would be more vulnerable to environmentally-induced migration (Wisner et al., 2004). In Uganda, in contrast, households have access to fewer resources and fewer opportunities for both temporary migration and agricultural intensification. In this context, it appears that soil quality enables costly permanent migrations as a form of capital. This result is consistent with the existence of a poverty trap which restricts participation in both migration and agricultural intensification for Ugandan households (Barrett, 2008), though confirmation of this process will require additional empirical research.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': 'The findings of this study have important implications for theories of environmentally-induced migration, for research methods in this field, and for development policy in Kenya and Uganda. Regarding theories of environmentally-induced migration, the results contribute to a growing number of empirical studies indicating that while adverse environmental conditions typically increase migration (Section 2.2), local and temporary moves are often most affected, and effects can also occur in the opposite direction. Thus Henry et al. (2004) found that migration could decrease with drought, Halliday (2006) found that migration could decease following a natural disaster, and Massey et al. (2010) found that local moves were most affected by environmental conditions. Similarly, this study finds that temporary moves were most affected in Kenya, and that migration marginally increased with soil quality in Uganda. Together these studies highlight the contextually contingent nature of migration-environment relationships, and suggest that skepticism is warranted for broad narratives that predict large-scale and long-distance displacements due to soil degradation or other forms of local environmental change (e.g., Myers, 1997).\\nRegarding research methods in this field, this study adds to a small number of previous studies which have combined household surveys, environmental data sources and multivariate analyses to examine environmental influences on human migration (Henry et al., 2004;Gray, 2009). This approach addresses the need for a robust, generalizable methodology in this field, where sophisticated empirical applications have lagged significantly behind the high level of interest by academics and policy-makers (Kniveton et al., 2008). Regarding soil quality specifically, empirical research would clearly benefit from additional household surveys that collect matched soil samples, as implemented in the REPEAT project and facilitated by spectroscopic methods of soil analysis (Yamano et al., 2004(Yamano et al., , 2005)). Future efforts should additionally consider collecting subjective reports of soil quality, enabling comparisons between the two data sources (Mairura et al., 2008), as well as repeating soil sampling in the same locations. The latter approach would enable a variety of analyses of how soil quality, livelihood strategies, and household well-being interact over time, including potential feedbacks between soil degradation and migration.\\nFinally, this study also has important implications for development policy in Kenya and Uganda. In Kenya, land-poor households with low soil quality appear to be particularly dependent on labor and temporary migration. This result suggests that expanding opportunities for labor migration, such as through the construction of rural infrastructure (Pender et al., 2006), will likely benefit vulnerable households without leading to rural depopulation. In Uganda, access to chemical fertilizers is very poor (Yamano et al., 2004), and potentially contributes to rural households being caught in a poverty trap. Policies that increase access to chemical fertilizers and other agricultural inputs via targeted subsidies, removal of trade barriers or improvements in infrastructure are needed to increase agricultural productivity and reduce rural poverty (Matsumoto and Yamano, 2009).'},\n",
       " 4: {'abstract': 'We analyse whether migration is an adaptation that households employ to cope with climate in Ghana and Nigeria. If migration is part of the present adaptation portfolio of households in developing countries, it is reasonable to expect that it will also be an adaptation to future climate change. It is important to stress that we are interested in long-term climatic conditions rather than in short-term weather fluctuations. The data to test these predictions are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey and the Ghana Living Standard Survey. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate in households that operate farms. We also find a significant hill-shaped relationship between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate in farm households. Climate has instead no significant impact on the propensity to migrate in non-farm households. Climate change scenarios generated by General Circulation model reveal that, ceteris paribus, migration may decline in Ghana and in Nigeria.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"The scientific evidence that climate is changing produced a lively interest among scholars regarding the economic effects of climate change.\\nIn this paper we study how climate affects migration decisions of households in Ghana and Nigeria. If migration is part of the present adaptation portfolio of households to different climatic conditions, it is reasonable to expect that it will also be an adaptation to climate change. Thus, with this paper we also provide estimates of the expected impact of future climate change on migration in Ghana and Nigeria.\\nIt is important to stress that we are interested in climate -the average of weather conditions over a long period of time -rather than in short-term weather fluctuations, which represent single realizations of climate. Our approach thus accounts for the long-run adaptation response to climate.\\nThe existing literature has instead mainly focused on the relationship between weather variability as well as weather extreme shocks, such as flood or drought, and migration. Overall this literature finds moderate evidence that out-migration is a response to agricultural productivity losses due to harmful weather events.\\nFor example, Feng et al. (2010) find that weather shocks that reduce crop yields in Mexico increase emigration to the United States. However, Auffhammer and Vincent (2012) demonstrate that this effect vanishes if one appropriately accounts for time effects. Gray and Mueller (2012a) study the effects of flooding on individual mobility. The authors report that, despite the expectations of a positive influence, flood fails to increase mobility in Bangladesh. Lower available resources and increased labour need after the shock may explain such finding. Bohra-Mishra et al. (2014) report that weather fluctuations more than sudden climatic disasters influence household permanent migration in Indonesia. Dillon et al. (2011) find that in Nigeria the likelihood of migration increases with greater temperature variability, which proxies for ex-ante unanticipated shocks. Moreover, male migration is positively influenced by hot ex-post shocks. Mueller, Gray and Kosec (2014) find that heat stress rather than high rainfall, flooding or moisture, are responsible for migration in Pakistan.\\nIn Brazil, Mueller and Osgood (2009) find mixed results. They report that climate shocks, expressed as the deviation from the mean precipitation, encourage migration if the shock occurred one to four years prior the year of migration. On the contrary, shocks that realized in the far past, namely more than five years before, discourage emigration. The authors reconcile these mixed findings arguing that the sample of migrants is composed by households which have been pushed to migrate due to the shocks as well as by households which have been attracted by urban 2 employment opportunities. Different studies relate exposure to drought and migration. Gray and Mueller (2012b) find that drought increases men's labor migration in Ethiopia. Henry et al. (2004) for Burkina Faso report increased migration as a consequence of scarce precipitations. Barrios et al. (2006) from a macro-perspective analyse the link between average annual rainfall and urbanization rate in Sub-Saharan countries. The paper finds that a decrease in precipitation is a strong determinant of migration to urban areas. Marchiori et al. (2012) estimate that temperature and rainfall anomalies produced the displacement of 5 million people between 1960 and 2000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Beine and Parsons (2015) on the contrary, find that neither natural disasters nor deviations and volatilities of temperatures and rainfall from their mean have a statistically significant effect on emigration in a panel of 137 origin countries. Having accounted for other determinants of emigration, including GDP, what the paper finds is that there is no direct effect of weather on emigration, by the effect of weather fully absorbed in the other (economic) controls.\\nThe analysis of migration response to weather variation and shocks is a very interesting area of research but the estimated elasticities should not be used to estimate the response to slowly changing climate patterns. Short-term responses may either overestimate or underestimate the long-run response. In the short-run households may react by implementing adaptations that are viable only in the short-term. For example farmers may implement non-sustainable management activities. In this case the short-run response is flatter than the long-run response. Alternatively, in the short-run households do not have the time to invest into adaptations that would alleviate the impact of a persistent change in weather. In this case the short-run response is steeper than the long-run response. By looking at the long-run relationship between climate and migration our goal is to provide a more accurate characterization of how climate change may alter long-run migration decisions.\\nTo our knowledge, only few papers have studied how climate affects migration. Munshi (2003) reports that low rainfall in rural Mexico is associated with larger emigration to the United States. Gray (2009) for Ecuador introduces in an individual migration regression a time-invariant value of community mean annual precipitation. While both internal and international migration are found to decrease with community precipitation, the authors report that negative environmental conditions do not necessarily increase migration.\\nIn this article we follow the spirit of the Ricardian studies of climate change impacts on agriculture (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Ricardian models assume that the long term productivity of land is reflected in agricultural land prices. By regressing land values per hectare on climate and on other control variables it is possible to estimate how climate affects the long-run productivity of agricultural land. The present sensitivity of land values to climate can be used to estimate the sensitivity of agriculture to future climate change, keeping all else fixed, in a comparative statics exercise. In this article we regress long-run migration patterns of households on climatic conditions and on other control variables. The advantage of this method is that it fully accounts for adaptation to the present climate. The set of adaptation options is large. In a rural setting, as in Ghana and Nigeria, households have adapted agriculture to local climatic conditions by selecting crops, the mix of crop and animal farming, irrigation, planting and harvesting dates. Household have also choosen the optimal mix of farm and non-farm activities to maximize their welfare. Migration is one of the many possible adaptations to local climatic conditions. The method thus identifies the relationship between climate and migration by exploiting the cross-section variation of climate and of long run migration decisions.\\nWhat is the expected shape of the relationship between climate and migration? It is reasonable to assume that with less favorable climatic conditions the incentive to migrate increases. However, migration is an expensive investment and it may be too costly for some households.\\nHigh temperatures and extreme precipitation patterns reduce agricultural productivity for many reasons. The relationship between crop productivity and average temperature and rainfall is typically hill-shaped. Farmers adapt to different climatic conditions by choosing the optimal crop mix, the growing season and the optimal mix of crops and animal activities, but at high temperature and at extremely low or high precipitation levels, the overall profitability of agriculture declines (Mendelsohn et al., 1994;Porter et al., 2014). For example, higher temperatures in the tropics reduce the size of the agro-climatic zones suitable for perennial crops (Porter et al., 2014). The migration of a family member can therefore compensate for a decrease in farming income.\\nMigration is even more attractive if adaptation possibilities are limited because of credit or information constraints (Nhemachena and Hassan, 2007). Poor farmers may lack means to pursue structural adjustments. Moreover, low levels of education can limit the possibility to adapt through technology or input switches as farmers may not be able to identify the most efficient inputs mix and the most appropriate technology to face changes in the external environment (Baez et al., 2008).\\nIt is therefore possible that farmers chose to diversify income sources, engaging some members in activities external to the family business.\\nClimate change at the low latitudes may thus well increase the incentive to migrate. However, it is important to note that migration is an investment requiring the availability of capital. Climate change may increase the incentive to migrate but, with incomplete and imperfect markets, households may not be able to migrate because they may see a reduction in the very capital required to enable a move. A worsening in the climate could be associated with a lower chances of migration. Gray (2009) labels this hypothesis as the environmental-capital hypothesis, whereby increased productivity due to better conditions provides the capital to finance costly migration. Thus, given these different channels, working in opposite direction, the relationship between climate and migration decisions deserves an empirical analysis.\\nIn this paper we narrow our focus on Ghana and Nigeria. The data are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey, conducted between 2010and 2011, and the Ghana Living Standard Survey, conducted between 2005and 2006. Both surveys gather individual as well as household information. We chose these countries as a place for the analysis, because the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region is among the most vulnerable region to the impacts of climate change. Moreover, both Ghana and Nigeria display a great geographic variability in terms of temperatures and precipitation between the North and the South. Nigeria and Ghana are also countries in which for many households agriculture is still the most important economic activity. As agriculture is more climate sensitive to climate than other sectors, migration decisions are more influenced by climatic factors than in developed economies.\\nMigration not necessarily requires that the entire household moves. The household can retain the local activities and send one or more family members in another location, to look for alternative revenue sources. In this respect we heavily draw on the predictions of the New Economics of Labour Migration, introduced by Stark and Bloom (1985), which emphasizes the role played by the family in migration decisions. The contributing insight of the authors is that the decision to migrate may take place within the family, rather than being an individual choice. Migration of some individuals responds to an overall family strategy, designed to adapt to a variety of conditions, including climate. For example, a farm household may send some members to urban centres to be employed in non-farm activities or to a different rural locations as a form of income diversification, ensured through the transfer of remittances on a regular basis. Climate may also affect migration in households that are engaged in climate insensitive activities as a result of general equilibrium effects at village or regional level.\\nOur results reveal that the relationship between the probability that at least one member of the household is a migrant and temperature in the dry season is hill-shaped. A hill-shaped relationship results as well between precipitation in the wet season and migration. The highest propensity to migrate is at 23 • C during the dry season and at 125 mm/month of precipitation during the wet season. This relationship holds only for households that are engaged in farming activities.\\nThe empirical findings reveal that migration decisions of non-farming households are not affected by climate, presumably because their productivity is not strongly linked, directly or indirectly, to temperature and precipitation levels. Our findings are robust to a series of alternative model specifications. Households located in districts with mild temperatures/precipitations have a positive chance to become migrant families if temperatures/precipitations increase. On the contrary, in districts with already high temperature/precipitations, the reverse occurs. Mild temperatures/precipitations benefit agricultural productivity and make migration more likely. On the contrary, for higher levels of temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape, due to low productivity.\\nWe also calculate non-marginal changes of migration using a uniform +2 • C temperature increase and a +25% precipitation change and by using geographically and seasonally differentiated climate change scenarios generated by the last generation of General Circulation Models using the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The large majority of the scenarios used suggests that climate change may discourage migration in Ghana and Nigeria.\\nA crucial assumption that we share with the Ricardian literature and with all cross-section studies is that the error component is not correlated with the regressors. Omitted variables that are correlated with climate variables would cause estimates of climate coefficients to be biased.\\nAlthough we cannot rule this possibility completely out, two strategies have been pursued. First, fixed effects at geographical level are added in all regressions. These fixed effects should absorb a large array of geographical characteristics and they should be a sufficient control to identify a causal effect in a cross-section analysis. Second a set of robustness tests are conducted, adding controls for soil quality and other geographic variables at district level.\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the method used to estimate the relationship between climate and migration. Section 3 describes our data set and section 4 presents the empirical findings. Section 5 computes local, regional and national marginal and non-marginal impacts of climate on migration. A concluding section provides a summary and a discussion of results.\",\n",
       "  'Methodology': \"The present paper draws on the insights of the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM), introduced by Stark and Bloom (1985). The contributing insight of the authors is that the decision to migrate may take place within a family or a household context, rather than being a purely \\n* j = γC i + βX j + u j (1)\\nwhere y * is the household's unobservable propensity to migrate, C is a set of location specific seasonal climate variables in local administrative unit i, namely precipitations and temperatures.\\nTemperatures and precipitations enter with a linear and a squared terms, separately for the wet and the dry seasons. X controls for all the household characteristics that affect household production activities.\\nFor each household we count the total number of members who live away and send remittances back home on a regular basis at the time the survey was administered. We define a migration household a family where at least one member is a migrant. In this article we capture the so called extensive margin of climate change on migration, as we assess how the variation in temperature and rainfall influences the number of migrating households, rather than the number of family members migrating (the intensive margin).\\nA household member is someone who is connected to the household by blood or marriage.\\nThe survey does not record the reason for not living within the household and some members may be away momentarily or because they formed a new household. To circumvent this limitation, we consider only households that receive remittances. In this way we better identify household members who move for productive reasons and we exclude those moving for education or marriage.\\nUnfortunately, the survey does not record when migration occurred emigration, but we believe that this is not a problem for this analysis. Climate change occurs slowly and therefore it is not requested to link single episodes of migration with climate variables. What matters in this type of analysis is the cross-section, geographical variation in long-term migration decisions and long-run averages of temperature and of rainfall. Finally, we don't know the individual characteristics of the migrating members. We only know if they live within or outside the country of origin. TSome households report having both internal and international migrants (with remittances). We define as an international migration a household where at least one member is abroad, irrespectively of the number of internal movers. On the contrary, an internal migration household has only members that moved within their own country.\\nClimate influences farm households directly but it also influences non-farm households indirectly via local market effects. Migration decision of farm households is directly influenced by climate, as agriculture is directly related to climate. Migration in non-farm households could be indirectly affected, through linkages between agricultural income, demand for non agricultural goods and demand for non-agricultural labor. Given that the channels are different in the two samples, all estimations are conducted for farm and non-farm households separately.\\nAmong the household characteristics that enter specification (1), we include an indicator of household welfare. Welfare certainly affects migration decisions but the sign of the relationship is ambiguous,, being correlated with the household income generation potential and the ability to secure against risk. On the one hand, wealthier households can invest more in local adaptation and therefore should have a lower propensity to migrate. On the other hand, poorer families may have greater incentive to migrate but they may also lack the resources to finance migration, and therefore might not be able to migrate. The welfare variable is computed applying the principal component technique (Filmer and Pritchett, 2001). 1 The advantage of this index is that it aggregates into a single measure a range of different variables, which individually may not be sufficient to differentiate the welfare characteristics of the household. In this study, the components that enter the index are related to the ownership of specific assets (e.g.: fridge, television .) or the characteristics of the housing structure. Given that the components that enter the formula are not solely influenced by the productivity of the household activities, this index measures the general welfare of the family.\\nThe asset index could be endogenous to the migration decision, as the assets that enter the index may be purchased through migrant remittances. To limit the potential endogeneity, the index is computed using the dwelling characteristics and the ownership of durables as they were five years before the surveys used in this study were conducted.\\nThe other explanatory variables for migration include age, gender and the educational attainment of the household head, the number of dependents, the urban or non-urban location of the family, the ownership of livestock and a control to distinguish between Nigeria and Ghana.\\nThe vector of explanatory variables should contain only variables that are exogenous to climate (Dell et al., 2014). The presence of controls that are themselves an outcome of climate would produce an over-controlling problem. For this reason we first present results of a specification where only climate variables are included. We then add the other demographic controls discussed above to assess the effect of climate on migration over and above its effect through the demographic controls.\",\n",
       "  'The data': \"The data for this analysis are drawn from two different household surveys: the Nigeria General Household Survey, conducted between 2010 and 2011, and the Ghana Living Standard Survey, conducted between 2005 and 2006. Both surveys gather individual as well as household information.\\nThe surveys provide an agriculture module, which allows us to distinguish between farm and non-farm households. We define a farm household any family which reports a farm or a plot operated by a household member.\\nMigration is a widely spread phenomenon both in Ghana and in Nigeria, with 43 and 23 per cent of households in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively, reporting at least one family member living away from the family (Table 1). The majority of households are classified as internal migration families, as they do not report any member living abroad. In Nigeria it is documented that a considerable part of the moves are represented by rural-urban migration (Black et al., 2006). In Europe and North America Nigerians represent the largest group of foreigners amongst Africans, although they correspond to a limited proportion of Nigeria's vast population. In Ghana internal migration is primarily from north to south, with in-migrants representing a large share of the population in the Greater Accra, Volta and Western regions. This internal flows are fueled by infertile soils and underdeveloped local services in the North (Black et al., 2006). The majority of migrant families reports only one member who lives away and sends remittances back home, but there are families who can quote more the one mover (Table 2).\\nAs far as agriculture is concerned, farming and livestock raising are by far the most important activities of households in both countries. As indicated in Table 3, nearly 48.5 and 44.1 per cent of the households report a farm or a plot operated by a household member or are engaged in raising animals in Ghana and Nigeria, respectively. Both in Nigeria and Ghana, as in many developing countries, the majority of rural agricultural households operates with small land holdings, which tend to produce few commodities at subsistence level. They barely have access to irrigation, improved seeds or fertilizer (Chamberlin, 2007;Liverpool-Tasie et al. 2011). These features are confirmed by the data, as indicated in Table 4. Less than one percent of households in Ghana and 4 percent in Nigeria has access to irrigation devices, and 0.2 and 1.5 percent owns a tractor, in\\nGhana and Nigeria respectively. The percentage of farming households reaches 73.9 and 72.6 per cent in northern Ghana and in northern Nigeria, respectively. The northern areas in both countries are also those where poverty is more widespread (Omonona, 2009;World Bank, 2011). The northsouth divide is also confirmed by the surveys. The asset index that measures the welfare of the households display higher scores in the south compared to the north (Table 5). The difference in the average index between the southern and the northern households is larger in Nigeria than in Ghana, being 1.03 units the difference in Nigeria and 0.78 unit in Ghana.\\nIn Ghana, migration occurs more likely among the farm households (Table 6). 48.3 percent of farm households reports a member away, whereas among the non-farm households, the percentage of migrant families declines to 38.8 per cent. In Nigeria, on the contrary, farm households are marginally less likely to be migrant families than non-farm households.\\nGridded climatologies of 1961-1990 monthly mean temperature and precipitations have been obtained from the CRU CL v2.0 data set developed by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (New et al., 2003). Gridded climate data has been down-scaled at each region's centroid by averaging the four closest grid points, with weights inversely proportional to distance.\\nBoth For precipitation changes we proceed analogously but we consider percentage changes rather than changes in levels, as it is common practice in the literature.\\nIt is important to note that future climate change scenarios are fundamentally uncertain. We lack information to attribute probabilities to each scenario and thus it is not possible to determine the most likely future outcome. Thus, the average of all climate change scenarios should not be interpreted as the expected climate scenario. However, due to space concerns, we present in the article only three representative impact scenarios, for both RCPs, in 2071-2100. The scenarios for the other models and for 2031-2060 are presented in the Appendix.\\nSoil data used in the robustness tests is from the FAO HWSD data set.3 A full description of the soil characteristics used in the analysis is provided in the Appendix.\",\n",
       "  'Empirical Evidence': \"In this section we present the estimates of equation ( 1). We control for a series of household and geographic characteristics. First, we describe the demographic characteristics of the household using the age, the gender and the educational attainment of the household head, as well as the number of dependents. Second, we control for the geographic location of the household. We include a dummy for whether the household is urban or not. We also add regional and county fixed effects.\\nThird, we introduce a dummy variable that captures whether the household owns livestock or not.\\nFourth, we include a measure of household welfare. Finally, we add regional and country fixed effects. The choice of the control variables is in line with other NELM models of migration. To account for possible correlation within geographical areas, standard errors are clustered at local level.\\nTable 8 presents the empirical findings, for farm and non-farm households separately. In specifications (1) and (3) we introduce only climate variables. Specifications (2) and (4) add also the control variables described above. Both the linear and the quadratic coefficients of temperature during the dry season are significant in the farm household specifications. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate. We also find a significant hill-shaped relationship between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate. These effects do not feature in the non-farm households. None of the climate coefficients are statistically significant in the non-farm specification.\\nAs far as the other controls are concerned , the table shows that wealthier households display a greater likelihood to migrate, as indicated by the positive and statistically significant coefficient of the welfare index. This indicates that poorer families may not find the resources to emigrate. The number of dependents does not influence the propensity to migrate. Location has a remarkable effect on the likelihood of migration but only among non-farm household. Among farm operating household, living in a urban setting makes migration more likely. Migration is not significantly influenced by the gender and the age of the head.\\nHigh skills are not a critical asset for migration for farm-operating households, whereas they represent a critical asset for non-farm ones. Families with a secondary and a tertiary educated heads are significantly more likely to migrate compared to families with basic and no education.\\nNigerian families display lower propensity to migrate compared to Ghanaian families. Among farm operated families, those owning livestock are more likely to migrate than those who don't own any.\\nLivestocks represent an asset for households that augments family wealth.\\nThe coefficients of the climate variables are robust to the inclusion of the demographic controls, both in terms of size and in terms of magnitude. A hill-shaped relationship indicates that farm households located in districts with mild temperatures/precipitations have a positive chance to become migrant families if temperatures/precipitations increase. In districts with already high temperature/precipitations, the reverse occurs. In a rural, underdeveloped setting the relationship between agricultural productivity and climate is usually hill-shaped (Kurukulasuriya et al. 2006). A possible interpretation of our findings is that at the optimal climatic conditions for farming, families are able to find the resources to emigrate. On the contrary, at high temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape.\\nAn interesting extension to this analysis would test the link between climate and productivity. 4\\nThe existing empirical studies find a moderate evidence that households respond to weather adversities by migrating. However, there is also some evidence that better weather and environmental conditions increase migration by allowing households to escape from a poverty trap (Barrett, 2008;Gray, 2009;Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013). Weather adversities in Gray and Mueller (2012a) do not influence mobility, likely because the shocks decrease available resources for migration.\\nTo give strength to these results, a set of robustness checks are conducted for the farm house-4 Unfortunately it is not possible to compute a reliable measure of agriculture productivity using the available data sets. The two surveys collect different information on agricultural inputs and therefore the productivity is not comparable between the two datasets. The existing literature on migration has identified that the networks formed by friends and relatives with previous migration experience is as an important determinant of migration. The networks diffuse information regarding opportunities related to labor and credit markets at destination and alleviate the risks of migration (Palloni et al., 2001;Massey and Espinosa,1997;Winters et al. 2001;McKenzie and Rapoport, 2011;Munshi, 2003). These factors contribute to increase the likelihood of migration. Table 9 adds a network variable, computed as the total number of migrants moving from the same local area of household j. 5 The coefficient of the network is positive but it is not statistically significant. We are aware that this is a poor proxy for the network, as stronger ties than just being a migrant from the same origin area should be embedded in the variable. For example a stronger link should develop from persons of the same area of origin migrated to the same local destination. Unfortunately detailed information on the destinations of migrants is not Available, neither in the Census nor in the survey. The hill-shaped relationship described above is robust to the inclusion of the network variable.\\nA cross sectional analysis of migration decisions can produce biased coefficients due to omitted variables (Schlenker et al., 2005;Deschenes and Greenstone, 2007;Dell et al., 2014). In other words, the empirical estimates can be driven by the presence of time invariant confounders that cannot be disentangled from the climate variables. To address this issue, all regressions are estimated controlling for geographical fixed effects. After controlling for these fixed effects, we expect temperature and precipitations in each local areas to be the main determinant of migration. However, the geographical boundaries of these controls are quite large (regions in Ghana and states in Nigeria). We introduce additional geographical controls at local level to avoid the possibility that other factors that vary within the regions and the statesmay bias the estimates. Average elevation, the standard deviation of elevation and distance from big cities are controlled for. Elevation affects climate directly but also affects economic productivity and mobility through other channels. Distance from large cities may be correlated with climate as remote areas may have an hostile climate. 6\\nNone of the coefficients of the geographical variables turned statistically significant (Table 10). The coefficient of the precipitation variable in the wet season and its squared are robust to the inclusion of these geographical controls. On the contrary, the coefficients of temperature in the dry season 5 The data to compute the network variable are taken from the 2000 Census for Ghana and from the LSMS for Nigeria. Individual weights are used. 6 The distance is calculated from the centroid of the district in which the household lives. We use three population thresholds to define cities: greater than 100,000 (100k in Table 10), between 100,000 and 500,000 (100k-500k in Table 10) and greater than 500,000 (¿500k in Table 10).\",\n",

Our results indicate that some soil characteristics are significant and have a sign that is consistent with agronomic evidence. However, the sign and the magnitude of the estimated climate coefficient, in particular of the precipitation variable are invariant, thus indicating that omitted variable might not be a problem in our main specification.\\nThe agriculture module of the survey provides detailed information on agricultural activities engaged by the households. In this section we distinguish households depending on the specific activity they conduct. In particular we define a crop-farm household, a household engaged in planting and harvesting crops only. We define an animal-farm household one which is employed in raising animals and not in planting or harvesting crops. Finally a mixed-farm household is engaged in both activities. Table 11 presents the empirical findings where the households are distinguish according to these criteria. Interestingly, none of the climate variables have a significant influence on migration among households engaged in raising animals only (column 2). Eventually, this results is consistent with the idea that animals cope better with climatic extremes than crops. Farms specialized in raising animals are less climate sensitive than crop-farms. On the contrary, families solely engaged in cropping activities display the hill-shaped relationship between migration and precipitation in the wet season.\\nThe survey allows us to identify if family members migrated within or outside the country of origin. We define as international-migrant a household where at least one member is abroad. On the contrary, an internal-migrant household has only domestic migrants. Equation 1 is separately estimated for these two households types and the results are presented in Table 12. While precipitations in the wet season are still a strong and significant determinant of internal migration, the coefficient of rainfall is no longer significant among international migration households. Moreover, temperature in the dry season is not statistically significant in any of the specifications. International migration is a costly phenomenon. Households that own the resources to send members abroad are not influenced by any climate-related issues. Climate neither boosts nor hinders the possibility to migrate internationally. In a final regression we compute a different proxy for mi- 7 We control for: the Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the electrical conductivity of soil, measured in dS/m; the organic carbon in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the percentage of sand and clay in soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.); the pH of the soil, measured in concentration levels (-log(H+)); the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, measured in cmol/kg; the calcium carbonate (lime) content, as percentage of total soil weight (%wt.); the calcium sulphate (gypsum) content of soil, measured as percentage of weight (%wt.).

Rather than capturing permanent migration of members, who left but are still connected to the household by sending remittances, we analyse temporary migration. A temporary migrant is a household member who is still part of the family but who in the previous 12 months has left the households for more than one month. This form of migration is typically a temporary, circular migration, in that a person moves back and forth from origin to destination. For example, a person might move for a seasonal job. The coefficient of the precipitation variable in the wet season is positive and statistically significant (column 3). This finding indicates that both temporary and permanent forms of migration are influenced by climate.\\nA caveat of this analysis is that only households with at least one member still in the original location are interviewed. This issue introduces a possible downward bias in the estimates at locations with high temperatures and at the very dry and very wet regions. Entire families might have moved, either domestically or internationally, in response to climate. Unfortunately it is not possible to account for these missing families.',\n",
       "  'Marginal and non-marginal impacts of climate on migration': \"In our preferred model specification (column 4 of Table 8) we find a quadratic significant relationship between the probability to migrate and temperature in the dry season and precipitations in the wet season. For this specification we compute the marginal effects of temperature and precipitation.\\nThe non-linearity in the relationship between climate and migration implies that the marginal impacts of temperature and precipitations vary at different temperature and precipitation levels.\\nThe marginal impact also depends on the value taken by all the other control variables. Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the impact of 1 • C of additional temperature and of 1cm of additional rainfall at the average of all other control variables.\\nThe marginal effect of temperature increase is initially positive and becomes negative at 24 We also compute the marginal effects at district level, at the average value of all other control variables for households in that district. Figure 3  As in the Ricardian literature, we estimate the impact of non-marginal changes of temperature and precipitations on each household's probability to migrate, keeping anything else fixed. We take the difference of the estimated probability to migrate with the future climate and we subtract from it the probability to migrate estimated with the 1961-1990 climate. This difference provides an estimate of the impact of an instantaneous change of climate. We start examining a uniform (over space and seasons) +2 • C temperature and +25% precipitation scenario. We display in Figure 4 2 in the Appendix provides summary statistics for all models, scenarios and RCP trajectories. Figures A-1 to A-8 display district-and regional-level maps of changes of the probability to migrate for 2031-2060, 2071-2100, for both the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5. Results from the other models are similar to those displayed in Figure 5. There is surprisingly low variation of results across different models.\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': 'Our study shows that climate affects migration in farm households in Ghana and Nigeria. We find a hill-shaped relationship between temperature in the dry season and the propensity to migrate as well as between precipitations in the wet seasons and the propensity to migrate. None of the climate coefficients are statistically significant in the non-farm households. This suggests that climate affects migration by affecting the productivity of agriculture.\\nA possible interpretation is that at favorable climatic conditions for farming, families are able to find the resources to migrate. On the contrary, at high temperatures/precipitations, households may be caught in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape. While the negative link between harmful weather and migration has been documented in short-run analyses, which do not embody the full set of adaptations (Gray and Bilsborrow, 2013;Gray, 2009), our study is the first example where this link features in a long-run perspective, which accounts for a larger set of adaptation measures.\\nThe analysis of marginal and non-marginal changes of temperature and precipitation reveals that climate change may reduce migration in Ghana and Nigeria, ceteris paribus. The subsistence level of agricultural households in Ghana and Nigeria can explain these findings. Adverse climatic conditions reduce the productivity of agriculture, even after including the whole set of present adaptations to climate. This productivity loss has a negative impact on the capital stock of households and reduces migration. While adaptation through migration is found to be a mechanism to respond to shocks and increased risks in the short-run by a growing literature, the long-run relationship between climate and migration seems to be more complex, as more factors affect households decisions. Our results suggest thatfor many poor households in Ghana and Nigeria migration does not appear to be a possible adaptation to climate change.\\nThe method that we developed in this article can be replicated in other countries for which data on migration is available with a high geographic resolution. Ideally, future studies should cover areas with larger temperature variance than in our study. One of the limits of our study is     Note: For Ghana, not all households specified the destination of the household members, whether abroad or in Ghana, and therefore the percentage in columns ( 3) and ( 4) should represent a lower bound.

       " 5: {'abstract': \"Despite the theoretical and methodological critique of deterministic and linear explanations of migration under changing climatic conditions, many empirical case studies in this fi eld remain deeply entrenched in static push-pull frameworks and tend to reproduce simplistic causal relationships. Drawing on results from an interdisciplinary research project in Mali and Senegal, the chapter presents a methodological approach that emanates from past analytical shortcomings. By adopting a local perspective on migration, we consider cultural norms, the migration history and people's interpretations of weather and environmental changes. Moreover, we argue for a multilevel, multi-method research that seeks to separate the two research topics of migration and climate/environment; for example, by avoiding explicit questions about possible linkages. Contrasting results from ethnographic fi eldwork concerning migration, climate and environment with 'hard' data on climate and vegetation allows us to become more susceptible for the social construction of alleged 'facts' such as droughts and land degradation as drivers for migration. We place a focus upon local meanings of weather and environment by considering how they are being assessed by the people, within a context of not only climatic but rather multiple changes.This chapter addresses the potential impacts of climate change on population movement by adopting a local perspective. Two case studies from rural Mali and Senegal serve to reveal the ambiguous relationship between climate change, environmental changes and migration. The relevance of the topic seems to be apparent in relation to the West African Sahel, given that the region's population is one of the most mobile in the world (Ammassari and Black 2001 ), while mean annual temperatures\",\n",
       "  '': 'have risen since the 1960s and increased precipitation variability is predicted for the future (Boko et al. 2007 ). Moreover, the severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s involved massive changes in vegetation patterns, thus rendering the African Sahel a hotspot of environmental degradation and desertifi cation (Kandji et al. 2006 ). Assumptions of this kind, embedded in the highly politicised discourse on climate change, perpetuate the belief that there is a growing impact of climate factors on population movements (Piguet et al. 2011 ), especially in developing countries, leading to estimates of the future magnitude of climate-related population displacements. However, most scholars oppose such estimated numbers and refer to people being at risk of becoming displaced rather than depicting possible migration fl ows (see p. 8 in Black 2001 ). The IPCC \\'s 4th assessment report emphasises the importance of migration as one of the key options for adaptation to climate stress, as well as underlining that a variety of other factors may contribute to the decision to migrate (Boko et al. 2007 ). This complexity of migration points to fundamental shortcomings in much of the scientifi c and public discourse on the environment-migration nexus. This chapter contributes to the present volume\\'s concern with context regarding the explanatory power of climate for changes within social systems. Accordingly, it seeks to re-contextualise assumed \\'natural\\' drivers of migration processes in order to balance simplifi ed assumptions of the relationship between climate, environment and migration.\\nIn order to identify population movements that are affected by climate change, it is necessary to understand the linkages between environmental changes and migration, considering multiple levels of analysis and different temporal and spatial scales (Kniveton et al. 2008 ). Moreover, further challenges that arise in understanding the migration-environment nexus include the lack of a clear defi nition and use of controversially discussed terms such as \\'environmental refugees\\'1 or \\'climate refugees,\\' the general scarcity of migration data, especially in developing countries (particularly longitudinal data), the lack of detailed knowledge about the impacts of climate change on environmental conditions (e.g. the evolution of local vegetation trends), and the failure to consider adaptive practices other than migration (cf. Adamo 2008 ;Bates 2002 ;Black 2001 ;Castles 2002 ;Renaud et al. 2007 ).\\nThe simplifi ed portrayal of environmental changes as root causes of migration has been contested by many scholars, both theoretically and empirically (de Haan et al. 2002 ;Findley 1994 ;Van der Geest et al. 2010 ;Henry et al. 2003 ;Piguet 2008 ;Doevenspeck 2011 ). Argumentation within the static push-pull framework has been further criticised for being too deterministic, since it suggests that migrants are being \\'pushed\\' out of degraded areas, rather than allowing for the various other dimensions of human migration (Jónsson 2010 ). With the exception of extreme events such as fl ight after natural disasters, \"[it] thus seems analytically impossible to identify a migration stream as principally environmentally-induced\" (see p. 51 in Doevenspeck 2011 ). Therefore, further research faces the challenge of balancing the multitude of factors shaping migratory patterns in the context of environmental change, in order to grasp the internal logics of migration dynamics (cf. p. 420 in Castles 2011 ). Similarly, changes of climatic conditions are unlikely to directly cause people to move, yet may produce environmental effects and exacerbate current vulnerabilities in a way that may render migration one possible strategy of adaptation.\\nAny attempt within the vast spectrum of approaches to understand the linkages between climate, environmental changes and migration also faces severe methodological challenges (cf. Piguet 2010 ). One major and general diffi culty is to evaluate an isolated correlation between climate or environmental parameters and migration variables, considering the complexity of other contextual effects on migration processes. Ethnography applying thick description through observation, in-depth and biographical interviews with individual migrants can avoid some of the diffi culties of other methods, given that it is a place-sensitive approach and provides an insight into social constructions of alleged \\'facts,\\' such as environmental degradation and droughts, people\\'s perceptions and experiences (see Meze-Hausken 2000 ;McLeman and Smit 2006 ;Mortreux and Barnett 2009 ). However, there are three essential shortcomings related to conceptual fl aws in interview techniques of ethnographic and quantitative (large-scale sample surveys) approaches. First, it must be recognised that research results are shaped by the way in which questions are formulated. Interviewees often undergo an intensive \\'problem-scanning\\' with respect to their migration motives, economic situation and environmental changes. Second, it is diffi cult to avoid general narratives on climate, the environment and migration issues. Third and most fundamentally, a causal linkage between environmental changes and migration is often taken for granted in research designs and refl ected in questions that directly ask for these linkages, thus leading to a perpetuation and reifi cation of this narrative. This is problematic, since it is the researcher rather than the respondent who hints at causal connections. Mertz et al. ( 2009 ) suggest how \\'hinting at problems\\' and causal linkages can bias research results, having conducted a study in rural Senegal to analyse people\\'s perception of climate change and their coping and adaptation strategies by applying household questionnaires and different types of interviews. To avoid biases, they only posed climate-related questions towards the end of the interviews. Indeed, none of the respondents identifi ed climate factors among the fi ve main positive or challenging aspects of their village life (not even within the category of agriculture). \"Only when asked directly about climate issues did the group interviews largely corroborate the impacts identifi ed in the household interviews, and they reiterated that rainfall variability during the rainy season is of major importance\" (see p. 810 in Mertz et al. 2009 ). This example demonstrates that suggestive interviewing considerably infl uences responses and should thus be avoided when seeking to grasp the relevance of climatic conditions and the environment for rural households.\\nGiven the conceptual shortcomings, this chapter will provide evidence of the complexity of the environment-migration nexus by discussing results from a research project on migration and local assessments of climatic and environmental changes in Mali and Senegal. As the Sahelian drylands are frequently presented as hotspots of climate change impacts (Hulme 2001 ) and the population is seen as very likely to become displaced by environmental degradation (IOM2 2009 ), two study areas in Senegal and Mali have been selected in order to understand how these assumptions translate at the local level. Macro data on climate is contrasted with fi ndings on local people\\'s assessments of changes in climate conditions and the environment (see also West et al. 2008 ) and contextualised with the identifi ed patterns, dynamics, motives and people\\'s notion of migration. Through this process, we are not evaluating the effects of climate trends in the study areas as outcomes of global climate change; rather, we argue in favour of assessing the relevance of various trends in climate variability and the importance of its different cultural, social and political dimensions by focusing on local people\\'s representation, perception and interpretation of climate and environmental changes. Considering the conceptual and methodical diffi culties of carving out the relevance of climate and environmental factors in migration decisions, this chapter puts forward a methodological approach that attempts to avoid suggestive causality between climate, environment and migration in the research design.\\nFollowing a presentation of the study regions and the methodological approach, we offer an analysis of current climate and vegetation trends and how people assess them locally. The second empirical part provides a historically informed analysis of the contemporary migration landscape, including patterns, motives and destinations, before the chapter concludes with some conceptual and methodological refl ections on this approach to grasping the local dimensions of environment, climate and migration.',\n",
       "  'Study Regions': \"Research is conducted in the two study areas of Linguère, Senegal, and Bandiagara, Mali (see Fig. 5.1 ). Both regions belong to the semi-arid Sahel-Sudan region, yet differ in their socio-economic context as well as their cultural and historical migration background. While the Linguère area is part of a traditionally important pastoral zone, the drylands of Bandiagara are mainly farmland, although crop production is important in both study regions. In Linguère, many of the pastoralist families nowadays are sedentary and practise both the cultivation of land and livestock breeding. However, our study focuses on general patterns of people's mobility rather than the specifi c movements of herders with their cattle. The selection of the study regions was based on the criteria of high population mobility, peculiarity of environmental change and accessibility of the regions.\\nThe area around Linguère is situated in the northern part of Senegal in the region of Louga, department of Linguère (also known as the Ferlo ) (Fig. 5.1 ). Around 80 % of the population lives in rural areas, with the Fulani and Wolof being the largest ethnic-linguistic groups (ANSD 3 2007 ). This agro-sylvo-pastoral area is sparsely populated (14 inhabitants per km 2 [inh./km 2 ]), characterised by an average annual rainfall of 380 mm and dominated by open shrub and tree savanna and grasslands (Tappan et al. 2004 ). Economic activities concentrate on livestock breeding and crop production (mainly millet and groundnut). Relying on the most recent migration data available (ANSD 2008 ), Louga shows an overall migration defi cit (ANSD 2007 ) with 18 % of Senegal's international migrants originating from this region in 2002, making it the third most important region in terms of migrant origins, after Dakar and Thiès (see p.  tree savanna. Rainfed agriculture and to a certain extent vegetable gardening are the main economic activities (MEA 6 2009 ). Dogon and to a much lesser extent Fulani are the predominant ethno-linguistic groups. In the early-1990s, the region's migration defi cit for both international and internal movements was among the highest in the country (Bocquier and Diarra 1999 ). Data from a 2005 survey reveal that 61 % of the interviewed households in the Mopti region mentioned one or more migrating members (WFP7 2006 ), thus indicating a long tradition of labour migration (Sieveking and Fauser 2009 ). Besides migration to Bamako (31 %) and other African countries (28 %), rural areas and villages (23 %) are also important destinations for migrants from the Mopti region (WFP 2006 ;Merabet and Gendreau 2007 ).\",\n",
       "  'Methodological Approach': 'Given the fl aws of the different approaches described above, we developed a multimethod and multi-level research design without asking respondents explicit questions about the linkages between environment, climate and migration, let alone asking directly whether climatic and environmental changes cause migration. As already pointed out, such direct questions by researchers tend to trigger answers that refer to master narratives of environmental migration and provide the respondents the opportunity to avoid elaborating on the subtle and complex social and political undercurrents that relate to migration. Moreover, we attempted to separate research on climate and vegetation trends from the migration issues by conducting the respective fi eldwork at different times. During the conversations, we tried to avoid making direct causal links between environmental and climatic factors and migration motives, allowing only the people themselves to establish such potential links.\\nWhile the identifi cation of the study areas essentially followed the idea of ecological inference (high emigration rates and noticeable trends in vegetation cover of a certain area), ethnography helped to identify migration dynamics and motives, as well as grasping assessments of climatic and environmental changes at the local level. Our fi eldwork could be best described as a multi-sited ethnography (see p. 106 in Marcus 1995 ) following migration networks to multiple places in the area of origin and the target regions of migration, which of course have to be understood as potential places of departure for new migration. This approach is motivated by the aim to avoid the sedentary bias inherent in migration research in Africa (see also Verne and Doevenspeck 2012 ). We conceptualise movement \"as constitutive for economic, social and political relations\" (see p. 43 in Urry 2007 ) and mobility as an integral part of human life and not as a problem per se , regardless of the place where this life is lived (see also Sheller and Urry 2006 ;Büscher and Urry 2009 ).\\nWe conducted fi eldwork during 9 months in 2011 and 2012 and used semi-structured and narrative interviews to understand the village\\'s history, directions and amplitudes of and motives for migration, as well as local meanings of these movements. Additionally, we collected biographies of migrants and identifi ed migration networks. On this basis, contacts with migrating family members at various places were established by telephone or via the internet, leading to interviews in Bamako and Dakar, as well as France and Spain. Working with migrants from the study area at their current residence offered valuable insights into migration networks, given that speaking to migrants outside the social structure of their home village seems to produce less biased and more explicit statements regarding their migration decisions. We used also interviews for the study of the assessment of changes in climate and environmental conditions, addressing both the state of and perceived changes of temperature, rainfall and wind, soil fertility, woody cover, biodiversity, capacities of pasture and crop yields (see Mertz et al. 2010 ;Roncoli 2006 ). We conducted the respective interviews with the same people who had already provided insights into migration, or, in case we were unable to encounter them again, referred to members of the same household or family from the same village. Village elders provided valuable information regarding predrought conditions and long-term changes in natural resource and farm-management. Additionally, we conducted transect walks and site visits with individual villagers in the surroundings of settlements. Attention was paid to people\\'s interpretations and explanations of already mentioned and visible changes in vegetation cover, the availability and exploitation of woody resources, soil fertility, crop yields and degradation phenomena. Accordingly, we took these impressions and information into account in later interviews in the respective villages. With the help of a village questionnaire, elders identifi ed trends in the tree species composition of the past 50 years (see for example Gonzalez 2001 ).',\n",
       "  'Changes in Climate and Environment: Local': 'Representations of \"Facts\"\\nWhile the Sahelian region has always been characterised by high climate variability, there is much uncertainty in climate trends and forecasts produced by the different climate models on smaller spatial levels for the West African Sahel (Boko et al. 2007 ;Kandji et al. 2006 ;Hulme 2001 ). When looking at environmental changes in terms of vegetation trends, it may be considered that not only climate (rainfall in particular) but also human factors contribute to long-term changes in the natural environment (Herrmann et al. 2005 ) Following Hulme ( 2008 ), climate can only be understood and must be re-examined as a manifestation of both nature and culture, which implies that its physical dimensions are allowed to be interpreted by their cultural meanings […] [and] that discourses about global climate change have to be re-invented as discourses about local weather and about the relationships between weather and local physical objects and cultural practices (ibid. p. 6).',\n",
       "  'Temperature': \"According to data collected from meteorological stations, an increase in the mean annual temperature can be observed for the western Sahel9 since the 1960s (see Fig. 5.2 ). Boko et al. ( 2007 ) state that there is a rising number of warm spells and a decrease in extremely cold days for the period 1961-2000 in West Africa. Peaks in high mean annual temperatures in the past two decades have been registered for 1998 and 2005. Beyond rainfall, rising average temperatures essentially account for reduced soil moisture and tree cover changes (Gonzalez et al. 2012 ). By determining physiological processes, changes and extremes of temperature may negatively affect crop and livestock production (Stabinsky 2011 ).\\nVillagers in both study areas expressed diverse opinions on temperature trends, providing a variety of interpretations. In contrast to the fi ndings from fi ve West African countries of Maddison ( 2007 ), stating that signifi cant numbers of farmers perceived increasing temperatures, most of the elders in our study areas agreed that it used to be hotter in the past. 10 A couple of interviewees in Senegal independently recalled a phenomenon in the 1960s when birds, paralysed by the heat and unable to fl y, came towards their houses and even into their rooms in search of cooling. Today, some said that suffering from the cold is worse than before, while others claimed that the 'coldness improved' and that it is getting warmer. Only a few people could not identify a general trend in temperature change, suggesting instead that hotter and colder years or periods have always alternated.11 People's assessment of temperature change is clearly infl uenced by their personal experience of seasonal heat waves or cold waves; moreover, even the availability of warm clothing and a blanket can have an impact on a person's views. In general, interpretations of temperature variations were directly or indirectly related to rainfall: the more it rained in the past rainy season, the less intense the heat, people explained. Leaf growth, cloudiness, wind direction and the existence of seasonal water bodies were said to affect the intensity of the heat during the dry season. It also seems that the perceived severity of high temperatures in the past has been reduced by the increased availability of water sources such as boreholes, wells, artifi cial waterholes and dams, compared to the period before the 1970s drought.\\nInterestingly, few of the interviewees perceived the rise in temperatures that has actually been recorded for the region, with most of them reporting decreasing temperatures. Given that abundant rainfall was said to reduce the heat, one potential explanation could be that the increasing amounts of precipitation in recent years (see next section) have signifi cantly infl uenced this perception. Similarly, Roncoli et al. ( 2003 ) report on the infl uence of the intensity and duration of rainfall on farmers' perceptions of dry season temperatures in Burkina Faso. Accordingly, narrations of rising temperatures evidently coincide with perceived decreasing precipitation (cf. Maddison 2007 ).\",\n",
       "  'Precipitation': 'The Linguère region is clearly drier than Bandiagara, as refl ected by a difference in annual rainfall of up to 200 mm (Fig. 5.3 ). While both study regions experienced several severe droughts during the twentieth century, the 1970s and 1980s droughts coincided with a long-lasting drop in the annual precipitation level. In Linguère, for example, this rainfall decline was almost 30 %. While rising precipitation has been recorded for the past two decades in Bandiagara, almost reaching pre-drought levels, Linguère\\'s rainfall has shown a slight increase since 1998. In 2009 and 2010, Bandiagara and Linguère had very abundant rains that locally even reached record values.12 Nevertheless, the apparent gain in mean values goes in hand with the increased variability and unpredictability of rainfall (cf. MEA 2009 ). In 2011, annual precipitation in both study areas did not exceed average amounts. 13The interviewed village elders confi rmed that rainfall today is lower compared to the period prior to the drought in the 1970s. Generally, people seem to have a good memory of the severe droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. However, it must be noted that there are differences between villages within the same study area, and respondents did not feel equally affected. In both study regions, the informants indicated an upward trend in precipitation in the past 5 years, describing the rainfalls of 2009 and 2010 as the most abundant for a long time. Accordingly, rainfall in 2011 was clearly evaluated as being low. However, assessments of the harvests during the past years do not reveal a uniform picture. In both Linguère and Bandiagara, some villages apparently benefi tted from good and very good harvests in 2009 and 2010, with people reporting increased numbers of young people reengaged in agriculture. In other places, most people stressed that the distribution of rainfall was of much greater importance14 than its total annual amount. Missing breaks between rainfalls, fl oods after heavy rains, persisting moisture on the fi elds and delayed, altogether lacking or too little rainfall during certain periods of plant growth mean that the harvest in 2010 was even lower than in 2011 for some households.\\nWhile the remarkable increase in precipitation over the past few years was confi rmed in both Bandiagara and Linguère, the local people assessed its impacts within the study areas very differently. Moreover, the interviewees also mentioned other factors determining yields, such as the access to seeds, pesticides and fertiliser, as well as their appropriate application, generally decreasing soil fertility and lack of agricultural land, equipment and labour force. 15 These fi rst results show that the total amount of precipitation can only refl ect a modest indicator of a \\'good\\' rainy season and does not necessarily translate into better harvests and increasing food security for everyone. Moreover, it is essential to consider the cultural dimension of people\\'s representation of climate (Hulme 2008 ;Peterson and Broad 2009 ). Therefore, Roncoli argues \"an inquiry into the cultural meaning that underlies farmers\\' understandings of climate, both its ordinary and abnormal manifestations, is a necessary fi rst step in climate application studies\" ( 2006 , p. 84). Important aspects that can deepen insights into assessments of climate include examining local terminologies and calendars for the different seasons (Orlove et al. 2004 ), or the exploration of local classifi cations and types of rainfall (Roncoli et al. 2002 ). Our respondents in both countries highlighted the impact of the timing and distribution of rainfall, which shows that \"unlike scientists, these farmers think about rainfall as a process rather than as a quantity\" (see p. 84 in Roncoli 2006 ). Given that a multitude of factors besides rainfall have an effect on yields, it is clear that climate can only be of limited explanatory power with respect to people\\'s vulnerability (Mertz et al. 2009 ).',\n",
       "  'Vegetation': 'Since the mid-1980s, remote sensing has detected a greening trend in large parts of the African Sahel, contesting the notion of widespread degradation (Anyamba and Tucker 2005 ;Olsson et al. 2005 ). Moreover, rainfall seems to be only one of the important causative factors for this recovery from the great droughts (Herrmann et al. 2005 ). While the data on local vegetation changes available for our two study sites does not provide conclusive explanations regarding the contribution of climate factors, it does provide an idea of general regional vegetation and land use trends over the past 50 years.\\nLinguère is located in the transitional zone of three ecological regions with different soil and vegetation characteristics (see Tappan et al. 2004 ). Depending on the soil type (e.g. deep sandy soils or shallow loamy and gravelly soils over laterite), there are considerable local differences in the agricultural potential as well as the mortality of woody plants (ibid.; see also Vincke et al. 2010 ). Generally, the trends indicate a signifi cant expansion of cropping land and a moderate loss of woody cover since 1965, but a relative stability since 1983. In Bandiagara, two major zones can be distinguished, with the Dogon plateau characterised by rocky soils and the Séno plain by deep sandy soils. Signifi cant losses of tree cover have been detected in the region during the past 40 years, albeit with considerable divergence in different areas (MEA 2009 ). Another study focusing particularly on Bandiagara describes the enormous encroachment of rain-fed agriculture and associated disappearance of natural woodlands for the same period, yet highlighting the recent success of governmental and villagers\\' efforts to preserve woody plants within agricultural lands (Yossi and Diakité 2008 ).\\nRegarding long-term changes in vegetation cover, local populations in both study areas report a tremendous decrease of woodlands since the beginning of the 1970s. For example, elders in Mali told us about dense forests during the time of their childhood. The interviewees related the disappearance of tree cover to the persistent water scarcity during the great droughts on the one hand, and extensive deforestation during that period to compensate for harvest losses by selling wood on the other. 16 A major change observed by the people is a decrease in the diversity of tree species: \"Today you have to walk long distances to fi nd certain medical plants and trees, some of them have completely disappeared.\" 17 Trees within agricultural fi elds are preserved by the villagers themselves and appear to be crucial for them: \"Where there are more trees, there is also more rainfall. Everyone wants to have trees on his fi elds, because it increases soil fertility and one gets a better harvest.\" 18 In both countries, people evaluated soil fertility as having decreased during the past 50 years, which they do not associate with a defi ciency of trees but rather with shortened or even no fallow periods as a result of insuffi cient cultivable land.\\nThese local assessments of vegetation change in the study areas reveal that, despite the enormous decline of woodlands since the great droughts and increasing preservation efforts being confi rmed by the local populations, there seems to be a discrepancy in the evaluation of recent vegetation trends, attesting a general greening and relative stability of woody plants. Interestingly, none of the interviewees highlighted a stability or increase of trees in the study regions; rather, they emphasised the lack of trees, high population pressure on woody plants, as well as offi cial restrictions and penalties related to woodcutting. This is in line with the fi ndings of Mertz et al. ( 2009 , p. 810) in Senegal, where people perceive a degradation of vegetation and do not relate it to climate but mainly to abusive use and population growth. Even if the woody vegetation is recovering in our study regions, cutting fi rewood is restricted to certain areas, requires a costly offi cial permission and therefore remains a source of confl ict and concern to many people, which thus might infl uence their personal assessment of vegetation trends.\\nIn this section we have discussed contemporary tendencies regarding climate conditions and vegetation trends in the two study areas, providing interpretations of these trends by the local population. Even though detailed information on smaller spatial scales is not available yet, data from meteorological observation 19 and fi eld research in the region generally point to positive trends towards more precipitation and a relative stability of vegetation cover (Tappan et al. 2004 ;Yossi and Diakité 2008 ). While people\\'s observations of the past profound changes in rainfall and vegetation correspond to recorded data, their assessments of current trends do not draw a uniform picture and seem to be infl uenced by the diverse impacts these trends may have. People interpret and feel affected by the changes very differently, and name a variety of non-climate factors on which their food security and livelihoods depend. Harvest output is a result of an interplay of parameters that goes beyond rainfall and the diversifi cation of income generating activities essentially contributes to people\\'s livelihoods. It is clear that annual temperature, annual rainfall or overall vegetation cover are not adequate and suffi cient parameters for making judgments with regard to the impact of climate on people\\'s lives on a local level.',\n",
       "  'Hoe and Mobile Phone: Local Migration Dynamics': 'The high mobility of people in the study areas has a long tradition and must be regarded in the historical context of West African migration dynamics (see de Haas 2007 ;Merabet and Gendreau 2007 ). Contemporary migration patterns in West Africa are shaped by colonial infl uence. The introduction of taxes and the high labour demand in coffee, cacao and groundnut plantations, mines or for large infrastructural projects have led to the development of a rural-rural and rural-urban circular labour migration pattern that is mainly directed from landlocked countries such as Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali towards the coastal regions of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria (Bakewell and de Haas 2007 ). Fast-growing urban centres and especially harbour towns such as Accra, Lagos, Abidjan, Lomé, Dakar and Cotonou have emerged as important economic points of attraction for job-seeking migrants. Environmental and climatic conditions have always contributed to shaping the causal, temporal and spatial dimensions of human migration in the region. For example, a north-south rainfall gradient implies that regions in the south generally have more favourable conditions for crop production, thus supporting a north-southdirected agricultural and labour migration. Moreover, annual transhumant movements performed by Fulani pastoralists or the dry-season migration practised by sedentary, agriculturalist rural households are well-known migration strategies of adaptation to the effects of seasonality of rainfall and periodic droughts characteristic to the West African Sahel (see p. 451 in McLeman and Hunter 2010 ).',\n",
       "  'Migration in Bandiagara': 'Our results confi rm that Bamako and the Ivory Coast are primary destinations for migrants from Bandiagara; moreover, apart from a few exceptions, international migration beyond Africa seems to be of lesser importance. Bamako has become an increasingly important destination thanks to rising job opportunities,20 particularly in the informal sector. 21 Much migration from Bandiagara appears to be temporary and circular, both within Mali and abroad. In most of the villages, a tendency towards the longer absence (temporary) or intensifi ed emigration (permanent) of young people, especially to Bamako, is associated with an increasing literacy rate and the lack of institutions of higher education or relevant employment opportunities. 22 As with many other ethnic groups in West Africa, migration as a \"rite de passage\" to adulthood is also an integral part of the Dogon people\\'s culture in Bandiagara, whereby virtually all young men temporarily leave their village to \"go on adventure\" (Dougnon 2007 ;see p. 62 in Doevenspeck 2005 ): \"It\\'s the chat. If you didn\\'t travel, you have nothing to tell. […] Besides, you feel less annoyed because you have experienced many things.\" 23 Usually, who is allowed to migrate and for how long is negotiated within the household, in order to keep at least a mini-mum of manpower at home. Young people repeatedly mentioned the lack of income opportunities in their rural home as a migration motive. For many interviewees, paying taxes, purchasing animals or farming equipment, a mobile phone or a motorbike are important objectives that can be realised through migration. 24The only connection between environmental and climatic factors and migration that the people established themselves was through describing an increase of seasonal labour migrants as one of their strategies to compensate for insuffi cient harvests caused by \\'bad\\' rainfall (see Sect. 5.4.2 ). However, as Findley ( 1994 ) has shown for the drought from 1983 to 1985, short-distance, temporary migration as a response to variations in the rainfall regime of the region is not new. Even though dry-season migration is still more important, the seasonal circular movements seem to take on increasingly heterogeneous temporary patterns, with people commuting at all times of the year. 25 Depending on the individual situation, they may return to the home village for less than 3 months per year, or stay away for several years and only pay short visits to the village for family events or whenever important community affairs have to be settled. 26 Interviewees reported that migrants\\' remittances play an important role regarding food security, especially for poorer households, since yields are insuffi cient to supply the families throughout the year. However, interviews in Bandiagara revealed that harvests crucially depend on a multitude of other factors in addition to rain, including the specifi c location of fi elds, crop diversifi cation and the degree of mechanisation. At this point, it is important to note that temporary migration is only one of various income generating activities mentioned, along with petty trade, vegetable gardening, selling animals, wild fruits and plant leaves as animal feed, or selling wood and charcoal. In a sense, all these activities can be regarded as adaptation strategies both to climate variability and economic hardship.',\n",
       "  'Migration in Linguère': 'Results show that mobility patterns in the area of Linguère are principally characterised by internal migration towards the cities and international migration towards Europe. By far the most prominent destination among the urban centres is Dakar. Even though repetitive temporary movements persist at present, young people nowadays seek to settle down permanently in the city. The most frequently cited motives for migrating to the urban centre were the same as in Bandiagara, namely education and proper employment and income opportunities. 27 One interviewee explained that anyone who fi nds a permanent job in town does not return to the village easily. A further reason is surely that movements from Linguère to the cities have persisted since colonial times, thus strengthening migration networks over a long period, which again perpetuates migration to this day. 28 Elders with their own migration experience emphasised the \\'bright-light effect\\' of the big city: \"Those people who are doing agriculture and think that agriculture is good and suffi cient don\\'t know anything and haven\\'t seen the big cities. […] They haven\\'t seen much in their life.\" 29Although people in Linguère critically evaluate the emigration of young people by hinting at the subsequent increased workload on the farms for their elders, they also appreciate the importance of education and the positive effects of young people\\'s migrations, as well as the importance of remittances, with typical statements including: \"If you abandon school, you abandon your family\"30 or \"Someone who lives in the city and sends money is closer to the family than someone who stays at home without means.\" 31Interviewees also made statements concerning environmental and climatic aspects in connection with migration. For instance, one migrant from Nguith in Dakar said that the formerly seasonal migration from his village to Dakar began to take on a permanent character following the onset of the droughts at the beginning of the 1970s, owing to decreasing yields. The community\\'s specialisation in basket making in Dakar permitted them to become increasingly independent from harvest output in the village. The chiefs of the villages of Kadji and Khogué specifi ed that some young people were returning to their villages and becoming reengaged in farming at the time of the investigation, due to the particularly abundant rainfalls in 2009 and 2010. 32 Even though the detailed circumstances remain unknown, it can certainly be assumed that they did not have a permanent and rewarding income in Dakar and might have returned to the capital in 2011. Another farmer from Linguère, when fi rst interviewed in 2011, emphasised his profi table engagement in agriculture. In 2012, he was encountered in Dakar, explaining that he had decided to abandon the last cropping period following a bad onset of rainfall in 2011. Thanks to family contacts and his migration experience in Dakar, he had secured work assisting a cousin in his mobile phone shop. Such examples highlight that fl uctuations in the amount and timing of rainfall are contributing factors in decisions for temporary internal movements, which are less regarded as a problem but rather a usual mode of living in a very mobile and multi-local social environment under variable climatic conditions. However, our data indicate that migration to Europe does not seem to have a causal relation to climate or environmental factors (cf. Jónsson 2010 ).\\nThe contemporary migration landscape is still largely shaped by historically established patterns, with most population movements taking place within the country or region. A common, albeit not new phenomenon in both societies is the trend towards increasing emigration to the cities, and capitals in particular, which people do not primarily associate with climate and environmental factors. Dry-season migration is a well-known and important strategy of adaptation to the annual variability of climatic conditions of the region. However, there are also increasingly complex and ambiguous temporal patterns of circular migration. As shown by the remarks made in some of the interviews, the variability of precipitation (for instance, the drought of the 1970s or the varying patterns of rainfall in recent years) affects migration dynamics to a certain extent. Moreover, it also became evident that in this case migration is not the only adaptation strategy and that there can be enormous differences in the migration dynamics of different villages. The motives behind migration decisions are very complex and multi-layered, even if some respondents directly mentioned aspects of rainfall trends when explaining migration decisions.',\n",
       "  'Bringing People and Places Back in: Local Insights in Climate, Environment and Migration': \"In this chapter, we have adopted a local perspective to explore the relationship between climate, environment and migration in two regions of Mali and Senegal where population mobility is high and processes of environmental degradation are said to increase people's vulnerability. We have shown that seasonal and temporary migration patterns in Bandiagara and Linguère have been traditionally adapted to climatic conditions, long before the international debate on the consequences of global climate change started. Migration in this sense is a well-established strategy to adapt to seasonality and variability of rainfall (Findley 1994 ;de Haan et al. 2002 ), but likewise must be regarded as an adaptation to processes of economic, social and cultural change. This places the focus of this volume's discussion on the multiple dimensions of local contexts in which climatic and environmental change and population movements occur. Empirically, two preliminary conclusions can be drawn from our results. Local climate variability continues to impact migration, especially the magnitude of seasonal movements, although it seems that the same climate trends do not result in the same migration responses.\\nFor example, increased rainfall in 2009 and 2010 contributed to the return of migrants to Linguère, whereas by contrast, negative impacts of the higher rainfall on harvests have played a part in increased numbers of seasonal migrants in Bandiagara. However, it is evident that the contemporary migration landscape is very much shaped by historically established mobility patterns and networks. In this respect, education and income opportunities in urban centres, 'going on an adventure' and returning to the village with a mobile phone or a motorbike for prestige reasons refl ect widespread migration motives. The destination and length of migration heavily depend on the migrant's assets, thus rendering migration a socially differentiated and selective process that does not provide a homogeneous image of patterns, destinations, objectives and motives. Complex migration patterns are embedded in an environment that, when looking at quantitative representations of rainfall and vegetation trends on a larger scale, seems to be undergoing continuous recovery from the effects of the great Sahelian droughts of the past century. However, by considering the cultural dimension of climate, people's assessments show that the timing and distribution of rainfall, or even the number of trees in the fi eld, may be more essential than increasing mean annual precipitation. People in different places feel differently affected by recent changes in climate conditions, further stating that climate is only one of many factors that affect their livelihoods.\\nIt must be recalled that the conceptual constraints in approaching the complexity of the environment-migration nexus imply methodological diffi culties. During research, it became evident that a clear distinction between cognitive perception and people's own assessment of climate and environmental parameters is hardly possible. The answers provided by the respondents are highly biased by the impacts of climate and vegetation changes on their individual situation. Cultural aspects, experiences and concernments all impact local assessments of climate and environment (see also Roncoli 2006 ). Therefore, this chapter proposes an approach that conceptually and methodically separates the two research topics of migration and climate/ environment. Separate research on local interpretations of climate and environmental changes allows us to deepen our comprehension of their cultural meanings and relevance for people's daily lives, rather than targeting climate variability and environmental degradation as a problem per se that requires migration as an answer. This approach is complemented by the inclusion of migrants at their current place of residence abroad, in an attempt to grasp mobility as a normality, a routinised practice of everyday life, as opposed to considering it as a mere coping strategy, a reaction to a concrete threat in the area of origin.\\nIn this respect, the present study contributes to the current debate on climate and environment as drivers of migration in the West African Sahel by presenting both a local representation of migration and a local assessment of climate and environment. Considering the local level empirically and contrasting climate trends and environmental changes in the study regions with assessments by local people allows comparison with similar approaches (see Mertz et al. 2009 ;West et al. 2008 ;Maddison 2007 ). The multi-sited approach of presenting local people's views on migration from the study areas can provide information concerning migration motives and helps to show that contemporary mobility must not be regarded predominantly as an adaptation strategy in the face of environmental or climate stress. Given this complex framework of mobility and local assessment of climate and vegetation trends in the study areas, it becomes evident that, as discussed above, concepts adopting a disentangled view on climate as the main driver of population movements are misleading. Rather, it is important to develop a deeper understanding of local meanings of environmental change and migration in the context of multiple social, political and economic processes of change in order to understand if, how and to what extent certain climate and vegetation trends play a role for what kind of migration.\"},\n",

       "  'Introduction': \"Climate variability refers to a deviation from the long-term meteorological average over a certain period of time. Most simulations predict exacerbated variability and increasing extreme weather events as a result of global warming (IPCC, 2001). Droughts or floods are examples of extreme weather events categorized under climate variability. Generally, such events are characterized by their severe effects on people's livelihoods, especially on agricultural production and associated food security. Food security 'exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life' (FAO, 2002b).\\nSince the 1980s, several studies have been linking climatic and environmental changes to human migration. It is difficult to find an environmental migrant per se, as there are various economic, political, social and cultural push and pull factors that influence the migration decision alongside environmental issues (see, for example, Afifi & Ja ¨ger, 2010;Warner, Erhart, de Sherbinin, Adamo, & Onn, 2009).\\nPrevious studies attempted to assess the effect of climate change and environmental problems on human migration. Empirical research has been conducted within the Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR) project (Ja ¨ger, Fru ¨hmann, Gu ¨nberger, & Vag, 2009) and a UNHCR Horn of Africa study (Afifi, Govil, Sakdapolrak, & Warner, 2012). These studies contributed to the literature with broad knowledge about the effect of climatic/environmental problems on human mobility. The Foresight Report ( 2011) is a meta-study that combines the literature and the existing empirical work on the topic in one document.\\nThis article, however, addresses the interrelation between a specific climatic factor, namely rainfall variability, on one hand, and food insecurity and human mobility, on the other. The research is applied on three villages in the Same District, Kilimanjaro, located in north-east Tanzania (see Map 1), on the borders with Kenya.\\nTanzania's long-term economic growth is dependent on natural resources. Agriculture makes up more than half of the gross domestic product and employs about 80% of its labour force (Tanzania Invest, 2012). About 95% of the agricultural sector is rain-fed and subsistence based (HBS, 2007). Therefore, the effect that climate variability has on predominantly rain-fed agrarian economies might clearly be demonstrated by Tanzania (Van Aalst, Hellmuth, & Ponzi, 2007). The majority of rural households suffer from either chronic or transitory food insecurity. The National Environmental Policy (NEP, 1997) identifies deforestation and land degradation as the second and third most urgent problems out of six that require attention, respectively.\\nThe main research objective of this article is to identify the circumstances under which households in the villages # 2013 The Author(s).

The moral rights of the named author(s) have been asserted. Bangalala, Ruvu Mferejini and Vudee use migration as a risk management strategy in response to rainfall variability and associated food insecurity. To do so, the following questions are addressed:\\n(1) To what extent are the households of the study affected by rainfall variability? (2) What are the top environmental, social, economic and other factors that influence migration in the three villages? (3) What role does the rainfall in association with elevation in the three villages of research play in out-migration?\\nThe article argues that rainfall variability affects human mobility, and highlights that the link between both variables is represented in food insecurity for humans and their livestock. It runs a comparison between the three villages with distinct elevations and associated rainfall differences, and shows that there is a positive relationship between rain shortage and out-migration, taking other socio-economic factors into account.\\nThe article introduces the research site and its characteristics; analyses the observations made in the field on the main three variables (rainfall variability, livelihood/ food insecurity and migration); and concludes and provides some policy recommendations. It is important to mention the research limitations briefly, for these to be considered/avoided in future research. The main challenges were the lack of follow-up with the same communities over a particular period of time, interviewing communities in the areas of origin rather than destination, the short time of field research (4 weeks), the small geographical coverage and the incomprehensiveness of meteorological data (Liwenga, Kwezi, & Afifi, 2012).\",\n",
       "  'Research methods': 'The study involves a mixed-method approach which combines expert interviews (government officials, Environmental and migration scholars, meteorological specialists and NGO representatives), a household survey of 165 households (stratified sampling by wealth ranking) and Participatory Research Approach (PRA) sessions with the communities (Rademacher-Schulz et al., 2012;Afifi & Warner forthcoming 2014). The PRA sessions included -but were not limited to -Focus Group Discussions (to allow for open discussions about various issues of research interest), seasonality calendars (to address issues related to seasonal rainfall), timeline and trend analysis (to detect the good and bad years and months in terms of rainfall and link that with food insecurity and migration patterns), risk ranking (to understand the threats the communities are facing and the way how they cope with and adapt to them), Venn diagrams (to get information about the institutions and individuals that play a role in securing food availability for the communities) and mobility maps (to find out the areas of destinations the communities reach when migrating). There were separate PRA sessions for women, men, elderly, farmers, non-farmers and marginalized separately, but there were also heterogeneous and mixed sessions with diverse characteristics. The household survey included questions directly and indirectly related to the three main variables of the study, namely rainfall variability, food (in)security and human mobility. Moreover, national meteorological data are considered in the study. However, a research limitation related to that is the lack of data that link the weather changes to migration flows in the research site. Therefore, there was a great reliance on the household survey and the PRA methods.',\n",
       "  'Research site characteristics': \"The three research villages Bangalala, Ruvu Mferejini and Vudee (see Map 1) are located in the south Pare Mountains, which form part of the Pangani River Basin, where the climate ranges from semi-arid to dry sub-humid, and the rainfall pattern is bimodal with a 'short' rain season called Vuli (October to January) and a 'long' rain season (February to May) called Masika (see Figure 1). 1\",\n",
       "  'Ethnic composition of the communities': 'In Bangalala and Vudee, the majority of the population interviewed belongs to the ethnic group Pare. Ruvu Mferejini is a more dynamic and mixed community which includes the Masai pastoral community that resides in the area dependent on water availability from the Pangani River for their livestock. ',\n",
       "  'Economic activities and income sources': 'In the three research villages, agriculture is the main economic activity (58% of the surveyed households in Vudee, 57.7% in Bangalala and 52.4% in Ruvu Mferejini). Nevertheless, activities related to livestock are minimal in Vudee as a highland (7%) as compared with Bangalala (23.7%) and Ruvu Mferejini (42.9%) (see Figures 234). Vudee has the most income diversification (which corresponds to the highest average years of schooling of the work force) relative to the two other villages.',\n",
       "  'Overall rainfall patterns': 'In the research site, the rainfall patterns and their distribution across rain seasons and years have become variable during the past two to three decades (Enfors & Gordon, 2007). Although the rain is usually of high intensity, it falls over a short period of time, which makes the water drain into the river networks and alluvial aquifers (Mul et al., 2011) and contributes to erosion before reaching the main rivers. This has negative implications for the production of the typical food crops, such as maize and beans (Mutiro, Makurira, Senzanje, & Mul, 2006). Therefore, the rainfall variability negatively influences food security of the communities in the three villages. In general, Bangalala (midland -900 m.a.s.l.) and Ruvu Mferejini (lowland -655 m.a.s.l.) are subject to less rain as compared with Vudee (highland -1950 a.s.l.). The average annual precipitation in the research area ranges from 500 to about 1000 mm (Enfors & Gordon, 2007).\\nA scoping study prior to the field research revealed that farmers in Bangalala generally suffer from rain shortage and consequent low crop production. In 2008, Bangalala suffered from an intense drought. Vudee, the village with the highest elevation among the three research villages has also suffered from erratic rainfall that led to crop failure.',\n",
       "  'Traditional adaptation strategies to rainfall variability': 'Although seasonal migration is a typical adaptation strategy for the community in Vudee, some members of the community migrated for long periods or permanently due to severe droughts from 1998 to 2005. As for Ruvu Mferejini, in contrast to the two other villages, farming depends on both rain-fed and irrigated agriculture due to the naturally scarce rainfall, but there are also pastoralists and fishermen. In order for the communities to have a regular and daily source of irrigation water, they rely to a great extent on the traditional Ndivas (water ponds) where the water is stored.   ',\n",
       "  'Field research findings': \"Table 1 shows the socio-demographic and economic profiles that resulted from the household survey across the three research villages. Almost half of the farmers are on the medium scale (49%) in terms of land ownership. Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage of large farmers' households in contrast to Vudee that has the highest percentage of small and landless farmers' households. Bangalala stands in between (see also average landholding in same table). This suggests that the elevation could play an important role. The communities in the lowlands might have better access to other villages/cities and more mobility. That makes them generate more income (especially regarding livestock business) as compared with the communities in the highlands (highest average farm landholding is in Ruvu Mferejini -2.11 ha as in shown in Table 1).\",\n",
       "  'Rainfall': 'According to the experts from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) (Personal communication during Expert Interviews, 14 March 2012), the total amount of annual rainfall has not decreased significantly throughout the past three decades (see Figure 5). Nevertheless, the annual rainfall data do not necessarily reflect its distribution and intensity, since large amounts of rain fall in only limited number of days, resulted in crop failure. Since the mideighties, the communities have been under longer and more frequent droughts, dry spells within the rain seasons, delayed rain season onsets, earlier rain season cessations and shorter rain seasons than expected; Figure 6 shows the decrease of the total rainy days per annum over the past five decades. Based on the TMA information, the five extreme lowest rainfall events in the district occurred in the years 1952 (314.04), 1975 (320.10), 1993 (302.40), 1996 (318.30) and 2005 (265.30) (mm/annual).\\nThe experts also highlighted the increasing temperature that leads to more evaporation of the reserved water in the traditional Ndivas. This was confirmed by the PRA participants (even in Vudee where the temperature used to be much milder due to its location in the highlands) who reported further that the winds enhanced by the lack of a sufficient vegetal cover often harm the crops before they enter the pollination phase.\\nThe PRA participants in the three research villages reported that in the past 10-15 years, the rains have started later and ended earlier than before in the two rain seasons (confirmed by 68% of households) and have been often interrupted by unexpected long dry spells (confirmed by 84% of households), which made it difficult for the farmers to plan. The household survey reveals that more than 80% of the economies of the households surveyed suffer from rainfall variability.',\n",
       "  'Livelihood and food security': 'The principal crop of subsistence in the site is maize with an average harvest just above 1 ton/ha (FAO, 2008a) and  a The interviewee representing each household was the head. In case the latter was absent, the next representative (usually the wife) who had to be grown up and who knew most of the issues within the household was interviewed. b Three households did not specify the size of their land in numbers, but the interviewer has recorded the category as described by the interviewees (small, medium and large).\\nvegetables are the principal cash crops sold at the Same market. Other food crops include lablab, cowpeas, beans, sweet potatoes and onions. The experts stated that the main challenge facing the communities is the occurrence of droughts that aggravate many problems affecting livelihood and food security in the research site as well as in other areas according to the dependence on agriculture and farming activities.\\nThe household survey -considering all three communities together -indicates that the percentage of people engaged in agricultural activities and farming has increased by 30.9% and livestock keeping by 18.8% throughout the past 10 years. This means that farming and livestock keeping have become more significant. As the focus on farming and livestock increased, the overall in situ livelihood diversification decreased. For example, there has been a slight decrease in the percentage of households engaged in casual daily labour by around 2.4% and the reliance on remittances have increased by 4.2% during the same period. This suggests decrease in local employment and increase in the employment of migrants in their destination communities.\\nAmong the most important threats to livelihood facing the communities according to the PRA sessions across the three research villages was rainfall variability (increase in drought incidences, seasonal shifts and prolonged dry spells) and water shortage in the traditional Ndivas. Drought took the first rank in terms of severity. These PRA findings were supported by the household survey that identified drought to be affecting 94% of the households, followed by storms and winds (29.1%).\\nRegarding food insecurity, food production has decreased over the past two decades. Rainfall variability affected the economy of 82.4% of the surveyed households and 82% have particularly suffered from decreasing income due to declining yields.\\nSince the climatic and rainfall changes have affected crop production and livestock activities, and thus, the livelihood of the communities, the latter have developed various coping strategies. The relatively wealthy groups tend to store food for future use. The medium groups apply the coping strategies of livelihood diversification, such as casual labouring for payment in food or cash. The activities include firewood sales, charcoal making, brick-making, selling livestock, seeking labour opportunities outside the villages or sending their children for labouring opportunities. Some also migrate to areas with better pastures and more water availability. The poor change their food intake, such as eating more wild edible products or reducing the number of meals or food types they consume; they also seek support from others in the community and government food aid or borrow food from wealthier households. As shown in Table 1, the wealth groups in the household survey were listed according to land ownership (small and landless farmers: own 0.004 -0.71 ha; medium farmers: own 0.712 -1.62 ha; large farmers: own more than 1.624 ha). Other factors considered for wealth ranking were the amount of livestock a  household owns (cattle, goats and/or sheep); the size of farmland a household owns; amount of food consumed; the number and type of houses the household owns; the number of assets a household possesses (cars, milling machines, radios, etc.); and the amount of money the household owns at the time of the interview.',\n",
       "  'Migration': \"The migration profile extracted from the household survey shows that the households with migrants in the research villages make up 54% of the total number. Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage (59%), followed by Bangalala (53%) and Vudee (49%) (Table 1). Elevation could play an important role in the migration decision; the lower the people are located, the more they have access to the surrounding communities. Ruvu Mferejini's reliance on agriculture and livestock rearing, and its difficulties with drought, also make migration a prominent consideration. Moreover, rain abundance in the highland (Vudee) may be another factor that increases the incentive to stay in the home community compared with the lowlands. In addition, as Vudee has the least amount of households whose activities are related to livestock, its inhabitants are less sensitive to rainfall variability.\\nIn general, seasonal migration (less than 6 months) makes up 53.4% versus temporal migration (more than 6 months) that makes up 46.6%. This indicates the reliance of the communities on agriculture and the associated seasonal conditions. The household survey further reveals that the number of economic migrants is twice as large as the number of educational migrants, which means that most people migrate in an attempt to immediately improve their livelihood, with a smaller group migrating as an investment in their future. Categorizing the migrants into landless, small, medium and large farmers, the average number of migrants per household is highest among the large farmers (2.46), followed by the landless (1.18), then the medium (1.06) and small farmers (0.65). From a logical point of view, one would expect that the poorer and less food secure would migrate more in order to improve their livelihoods. However, it is usually the large farmers who possess sufficient means to leave, and their migration decision might not necessarily be related to food insecurity but rather pull factors in the areas of destination. The landless might have a stronger reason to migrate than the medium or small farmers, even if the former must fund their move through loans from others, in order to survive their deprivation and food insecurity. One other factor that might facilitate the migration decision for this category is that the lack of land ownership also removes responsibility and obligations which could otherwise reduce mobility. In addition, there would be no potential land disputes to concern them during their return as it might be in the case of small and medium landholders.\\nHistorically, migration has always existed in the research site, but it has increased in the past three decades and is mainly preceded by droughts. The PRA focus group discussions revealed that people do migrate in search of food, and livestock keepers have to migrate in search of pasture and water. Both decisions highly depend on the climatic conditions. For example, if the long rainy season Masika fails, people migrate mainly from May through August.\\nMoving to the factors that were listed in the household survey as 'very important' for taking a migration decision. Figure 7 shows that the increase in drought frequency predominates, followed in order by water shortage, flooding, lack of land for grazing, unreliable harvests, decline of crop production for consumption and shifted seasonal rainfalls. It seems that the interviewed household representatives do not consider the seasonal shifts to be a significant problem, as seasonal migration occurs in any case. The same figure shows that it is Ruvu Mferejini that is affected at most, which goes in line with the above observations regarding irregular rain and water shortage as compared with the other villages. In contrast, the same factors seem not to be as important in the case of Vudee, also for the same argument (relative abundance of rain in the village). What confirms this argument is that Bangalala, at a halfway mark between Ruvu and Vudee in terms of poverty, elevation, rainfall and migration, also scored the importance of the factors between the scores of the other two villages.\\nIn the PRA sessions, migration was ranked very high as a coping strategy for food insecurity across the three villages; people migrate, in a sense by following water, in order to improve their livelihoods and feed their animals. The respondents highlighted that the worst droughts were the ones that significantly disrupted their livelihood system in terms of crop and livestock production and resulted in people migrating to other locations. Furthermore, they complained about the migration strategy, even though it is broadly applied, as it results in the families and dependents being neglected for long periods.\\nMap 2 shows the location of the three research villages, the migration destinations, the average precipitation, the agricultural land and the drought frequency/rainfall variability.\",\n",
       "  'Discussion': 'The analysis above shows that the rainfall patterns and the degree of their effects on migration vary among the specific villages; the modest migration records in Vudee (highland) can be attributed to the fact that it is the wettest village rainwise (highest precipitation) and the poorest in terms of landholdings, and therefore people might lack the means for migration. At the same time, the generally generous rain gives them less reason to migrate and the higher than average level of education reduces the need for them to send their children elsewhere. Moreover, it has the highest average years of schooling and the most teachers (self sufficiency and no need for schools outside the village). The fact that Vudee has the highest number of elderly as compared with the two other research villages might also contribute to the relative immobility. On the contrary, Ruvu Mferejini (lowland) is the village with lowest precipitation and the richest in terms of landholdings. The mobility of the population in this village as compared with the two others (also see migration arrows on Map 2) could be attributed to its closeness to urban areas (search of jobs to improve livelihoodpull factors), as well as the largest representation of pastoral communities that need to feed their livestock and are therefore more sensitive to water availability (Ruvu Mferejini has the highest percentage of people dependent on livestock activities from the three villages). The relatively great wealth of the village might give the communities better opportunities to migrate, and at the same time, this wealth might be attributed to their access to urban centres (remittances). Bangalala (midland) lies in between regarding all these variables, including migration.',\n",
       "  'Conclusions and recommendations': 'Rainfall variability has a clear effect on food security of the communities of the three research villages, and hence, on their human mobility. More than 80% of the economies of the households surveyed have been affected by rainfall variability. Frequent droughts and water shortage are the top factors that influence migration in the overall research site. Diverse levels of elevation and precipitationamong other socio-economic factors -across the three villages of research are associated with respectively various migration patterns. In the highest, wettest and poorest village with the highest rate of education and with the oldest population age wise, out-migration is the least.\\nIt is important that the traditional Ndivas are well maintained and used on a larger scale, such that the water stored in them can be used more broadly and can provide the maximum amount of land with water for longer periods. It is also essential that the Ndiva water is economized, so that the negative effects of evaporation are mitigated. Moreover, it is crucial that the communities who prefer to stay or cannot afford to migrate receive support. Making use of the remittances in a systematic way (development projects and micro-scale investments) can support their livelihoods in situ. As to the migrants, their value added to the areas of destination should be maximized by involving them in activities that match their skills (e.g. farming and construction), so that they actively contribute to the overall welfare of the new areas on one hand and to the well-being of themselves and their families on the other.'},\n",
       " 7: {'abstract': 'Objectives By 2050, over 250 million people will be displaced from their homes by climate change. This exploratory case study examines how climate-driven migration impacts the health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors of Maasai in Tanzania. Increasing frequency and intensity of drought is killing livestock, forcing Maasai to migrate from their rural homelands to urban centers in search of ways to support their families. Little existing research investigates how this migration changes the way migrants think about health and make healthcare decisions. Methods This study used semi-structured qualitative interviews to explore migrant and non-migrant beliefs surrounding health and healthcare. Migrant and non-migrant participants were matched on demographic characteristics and location. Results Migrants emphasized the importance of mental health in their overall health perceptions, whereas nonmigrants emphasized physical health. Although non-migrants perceived more barriers to accessing healthcare, migrant and non-migrant help-seeking behaviors were similar in that they only sought help for physical health problems, and utilized hospitals as a last option. Conclusions These findings have implications for improving Maasai healthcare utilization, and for future research targeting other climate-driven migrant populations in the world.',\n",

       "  'Climate-driven migration and health': \"By the year 2050, scientists predict that climate change will displace more than 250 million people from their homelands (McMichael et al. 2012). Increasing temperatures and frequencies of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms are turning people into ''environmental refugees'' (Jeacocke 2010). Because climate change causes environmental degradation, health problems, and destruction of economic resources, impacted populations move to places perceived to offer a better life (McMichael et al. 2012).\\nEnvironmental change vulnerability, which is a combined measure of a community's exposure to climatic change, its sensitivity to these changes, and its ability to adapt (Confalonieri et al. 2007;McLeman and Hunter 2010), is particularly high in Sub-Saharan African countries. These countries are projected to face intense effects of climate change (World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization 2012), and bear some of the largest global disease burdens. Furthermore, many countries in this region have insufficient infrastructure to handle large societal changes such as increased climate-driven migration (Confalonieri et al. 2007).\\nResearch has extensively explored the impacts of nonclimate-driven migration on the mental and physical health of individual migrants (McKay et al. 2003;Bhugra 2004), but has yet to investigate whether a climatic driver of migration will influence or alter those health impacts (McMichael et al. 2012). Climate-driven migrations are often internal, from rural areas to urban centers within the same country (McMichael et al. 2012). Generally, urban environments place migrants' physical and mental health at risk (Friel 2011). Many suffer from homelessness, joblessness, social marginalization, and food insecurity (McMichael et al. 2012). These life circumstances can result in health challenges, such as depression, malnutrition, and infectious disease (McMichael et al. 2012).\\nThe Maasai in Tanzania: a case study This case study explores these issues with a focus on climate-driven rural-to-urban migration of a sample of Maasai people in Tanzania. The Maasai are pastoralists living in rural regions of Tanzania and Kenya. Cultural traditions include male circumcision, polygamy, arranged marriage, and a period of warriorship for the males (Biswas-Diener et al. 2005). Rural Maasai live in bomas, groups of six to ten Maasai mud huts that have no running water or electricity and are isolated from urban society. Men own and care for the livestock, whereas women manage the household and care for the children. They speak a language unique in Tanzania, kimaasai, and rarely obtain formal secondary education (Coast 2002).\\nDroughts have been driving the Maasai in Tanzania out of their rural homelands and into urban areas. In a 2012 study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 81 % of Maasai migrants reported drought as the primary reason they moved into the city from their villages (Riley et al. 2012). Migration is driven by the loss of livestock, the main source of livelihood for Maasai people. Increased drought frequency and duration cause food and water shortages that render the Maasai incapable of sustaining their livestock, resulting in migration to cities in search of new opportunities. A common destination for Maasai migrants is the city of Arusha, which has a population of about 1 million (National Bureau of Statistics 2012) and is the largest tourist hub in Tanzania.\",\n",
       "  'Development of an illness behavior conceptual framework': \"This study explores Maasai migrant and non-migrant beliefs and behaviors related to seeking help for health problems. Illness behavior is an umbrella term encompassing human response to sickness and suffering (Sirri et al. 2013). It is the observation of the body, interpretation of symptoms, and formulation of a plan to improve one's health (Christakis et al. 1994). Help-seeking behavior is a subcategory of illness behavior. Help-seeking behavior is the act of seeking assistance or advice in response to a change in one's perceived health (Cornally and McCarthy 2011).\\nA conceptual framework of illness behavior (Fig. 1), which is a synthesis of several existing theories (Andersen 1995;Bailis et al. 2003;Leventhal et al. 2003;Jylha ¨2009), underpins this study. There are three main questions an individual answers in this framework: (1) Do I have a health problem? (2) Do I want to seek help? (3) From whom do I seek help?\\nAn internal or external input catalyzes the help-seeking process by making people attend to and evaluate their health statuses. Individuals must interpret these inputs to determine whether or not they have a health problem (Andersen 1995;Leventhal et al. 2003). Next, an individual must decide whether or not to seek help. Leventhal's Common Sense Model and Andersen's Socio-behavioral Model both assert that people constantly assess their own health and use those assessments to judge whether their health problems are of sufficient magnitude to seek help (Leventhal et al. 2003;Andersen 1995). Lastly, in developing countries, one usually decides between traditional healers and biomedicine (Kroeger 1983;Christakis et al. 1994). Many personal, environmental, and societal factors influence these decisions, as shown in Fig. 1.\",\n",

Little to no research has been done on illness behaviors of the Maasai, so it was necessary to build a foundation of knowledge using a rich qualitative methodology.\\nThis case study utilizes a matched sample of migrant and non-migrant Maasai to explore the following research questions: (1) how, if at all, do perceptions of what it means to be healthy differ between climate-driven Maasai migrants living in a developed urban setting and non-migrant Maasai living in a traditional rural village setting? (2) How do perceived health problems differ between these two groups? (3) How do help-seeking attitudes and behaviors differ between these two groups?',\n",

       "  'Selection of study sample': \"Interviews were conducted in two demographically matched Maasai populations: rural-to-urban migrants and permanent rural residents (i.e., non-migrants).\\nMigrant participants (8 males, 6 females) were recruited in Arusha, Tanzania. Most Maasai men in Arusha migrated from Longido district, which is the most isolated Maasai district. At a community meeting in Arusha, a purposeful sample of eight Maasai men was selected using the study's inclusion criteria: each male participant must be Maasai, living in Arusha, over 18 years old, and from Longido district.\\nMost female Maasai migrants originated from Simanjiro district. The project coordinator and translator recruited female participants (n = 6) by visiting them at their work places and explaining the study goals. Inclusion criteria were the same as for male migrants, except all female participants originated from Simanjiro district.\\nNon-migrant interviews took place in rural villages in Longido district for men (n = 8), and Simanjiro district for women (n = 6). None of the non-migrant participants had ever migrated to an urban area, and were purposefully chosen to have similar demographic characteristics to the migrant participants (Table 1). The two samples were matched based on socioeconomic indicators in the Maasai culture: age group, gender, number of wives, number of children, marital status, number of siblings, and education (Riley et al. 2012).\",\n",
       "  'Data collection': \"Data collection spanned 8 weeks during July and August 2013, and consisted of 28 qualitative interviews. The major part of the interview consisted of open-ended questions that explored the participant's beliefs surrounding health and help seeking. This open-ended section of the interview was constructed based on the literature and guided by the newly developed illness behavior theoretical framework. Table 2 shows example interview questions and the full interview protocol is given in Online Resource 1.\\nPrior to recruiting study participants, all interview questions were reviewed by the Maasai project coordinator to ensure that the questions were culturally and linguistically appropriate. A pilot interview with a migrant Maasai man in Arusha resulted in revisions to the interview protocol.\\nAll interviews used the same Maasai translator. Participants chose whether to speak Maasai or Swahili, and all but one chose to speak Maasai. Each migrant participant received a drink and/or a meal and each non-migrant participant received a blanket in thanks for their participation. These gifts were financially equivalent and were decided upon based on the greatest needs of the participants.\",\n",

Data analysis was guided by inductive and deductive thematic approaches (Miles et al. 2013). The researchers developed a coding framework containing both external and internal codes. Codes external to the study stemmed from previous research, while internal grounded codes prioritized the voice and perspective of the study participants. Codes  Have you ever gone to the hospital?

The first pass codes were categorical codes that served as the highest thematic level of coding. Second pass coding consisted of subcodes for the first pass categorical codes to add specificity and depth to the identified themes. Throughout the iterative process of coding and categorizing, analytic memos were used to explore possible connections between themes and subthemes, allowing the formulation of propositions through the constant comparison method (Glaser 1965). Assertions and propositions were tested using matrices and other data displays (Miles et al. 2013). Negative case analysis helped to verify conclusions made from propositions and assertions (Bernard and Ryan 1998).',\n",
       "  'Findings': '',\n",
       "  'Driving forces of migration': \"Although it was expected that both men and women migrated to Arusha due to climate change, interviews revealed that this was only true for male migrants. All Maasai migrants in this study were driven to migrate by the need for money to support their families. However, male and female migrants in this study were differentially driven to seek out monetary income (Fig. 2). In accordance with the literature, droughts drove men to migrate, because the dry climate killed the men's livestock, and left them with no livelihood. In contrast, women were driven to become the family breadwinners when their male providers either died or became unable to work. When their husbands had few livestock, the women looked for business opportunities in Arusha to support their families, such as selling jewelry, tobacco, and tea. Both male and female migrants left their families at home in the villages, and sent remittances to pay for more livestock, food, school fees, and healthcare.\\nDespite having different reasons for migrating, male and female migrant participants had very similar beliefs surrounding health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors. Hence, further findings of this study will not be segregated by gender.\",\n",
       "  'Differences in perceptions of what it means to be healthy': \"All migrant and non-migrant participants identified both mental and physical health in their constructs of health (Fig. 3). Within mental health, study participants believed that a healthy person is both happy and has low levels of stress. Mostly, participants referred to being happy as a direct result of feeling no stress. A migrant woman said, ''thinking and stress and worries, that is not healthy'' (#14, migrant female).\\nParticipants identified three important aspects of physical health: being energetic and strong, having a healthy weight, and not feeling sick. Study participants believed that ''when you are healthy, you have energy, are strong, it means you can work'' (#26, non-migrant male). Furthermore, most participants discussed a healthy weight by saying, ''health means being huge, fat'' (#12, migrant female). Lastly, participants acknowledged that a healthy person is ''not sick and doesn't have any illness in his body'' (#15, non-migrant female). Across all participants, feeling ill always indicated poor health, but lack of illness did not necessarily indicate good health if the person did not meet the other three criteria of energy/strength, healthy weight, and lack of stress.\\nWhile all participants identified these four aspects of health, migrants placed more importance on mental health and non-migrants on physical health in their perceptions of what it means to be healthy (Fig. 3). When asked about ideal health, health goals, and extremely healthy individuals, Climate-driven migration: an exploratory case study of Maasai health perceptions and help… 645 migrants discussed lack of stress much more often than being energetic, strong, and sick, whereas non-migrants talked about the importance of good physical health more often than the importance of good mental health.\",\n",
       "  'Differences in perceived health problems': 'Migrant participants struggled with mental health problems like stress, unhappiness, and loneliness more than did nonmigrant participants. Maasai in Arusha attributed their poor mental health to shouldering large responsibility, feeling trapped and hopeless, lacking social support, and feeling homesick.',\n",
       "  'Responsibility': \"Migrant participants felt a more intense and urgent sense of responsibility to provide for their families than did non-migrant participants. All migrant participants moved to Arusha in search of income to support their families at home. Many were solely responsible for providing for their wives, children, parents, and/or siblings, and they felt intense anxiety over being able to provide for them. A migrant man reflected on his stress surrounding his family's well-being:\\nI feel like an elder and more responsible, I have been thinking about my wives, that they live well and eat well, and now I have children. I think of and worry about them all the time, that they go to school and eat well, and just to think about how I can make their lives comfortable. If I start thinking about all those things, I feel unhealthy because of worries about making life comfortable for my family.\\n(#8, migrant male)\\nWhile non-migrants mentioned feeling responsibility and some anxiety surrounding their families' well-being, they did not emphasize it as much as migrants did. Migrant participants discussed responsibility, stress, and unhappiness more frequently than did non-migrants, and with greater intensity.\",\n",
       "  'Lack of social support': \"Lacking social support and being far from home contributed to the poor mental health of male migrant participants. Migrant men felt homesick, missed their families, worried about the states of their children or siblings at home, and all had the ultimate goal of moving home. When the men returned home, they said it was ''the only time they felt fresh again'' (#3, migrant male). Home provided the social support they were missing, they got to see their livestock, and they were able to sleep peacefully. Being away from family in the stressful living conditions of Arusha made them feel isolated and lonely.\\nSome men described getting angry when their employers did not allow them to go home, and many voiced having had feelings of losing hope and wanting to give up and go home. Almost all migrant male participants worked as night guards for residences in Arusha. Night guard work is stressful because the men are accountable to their employers for anything that gets stolen or broken, and there is always the threat of dangerous thieves that will ''slaughter and cut you all over'' (#4, migrant male). However, the men feel trapped in Arusha, with no other way to provide for their families. While home provides social support, moving home without income would place them in the stressful situation that forced them to migrate in the first place. This no win cycle enhances a feeling of hopelessness and lack of control for migrant men specifically.\\nMigrant women did not discuss feeling homesick as often as migrant men. This could be because women had a stronger sense of community in Arusha. They all worked together during the days and slept in a rented room together at night. Additionally, they had more freedom to travel home, since they were self-employed selling jewelry, tea, and snuff. and symptoms such as pain, swelling, fever, cough, and chest pain. Notably, neither migrant, nor non-migrant participants cited stress or depression as internal inputs that catalyzed a help-seeking response. They emphasized that improved life circumstances, not healthcare treatment, would alleviate mental health challenges.\\nFrom whom do I seek help?\\nAlthough herbal and western medicines were both used, migrant and non-migrant participants agreed upon an order in which they were normally sought out. Herbal medicine was almost always the first line of treatment for a health problem. This type of traditional medicine makes someone ''have diarrhea and vomit and it gets all the dirt out'' (#3, migrant male). If the herbal medicine was ineffective, and the person continued to feel sick or got worse, then he or she would go to the hospital. Consequently, hospitals were used as a last resort treatment.\",\n",
       "  'Factors that influence help-seeking decisions': 'While this chronology of treatment usage remained constant between migrants and non-migrants, non-migrants perceived more barriers to accessing western healthcare. Both migrants and non-migrants identified long wait times and distrust as barriers to accessing western healthcare, but non-migrants also discussed transport cost, distance to the hospital, healthcare cost, and resource shortages at hospitals and clinics as barriers (Fig. 4).',\n",
       "  'Discussion': \"The results of this exploratory case study illuminate a mismatch between Maasai migrants' perceived health problems and health perceptions, and their help-seeking behaviors. Migrants suffered more from mental health issues and placed higher importance on mental health, but they continued to only seek help for physical health problems. Additionally, migrant participants perceived fewer barriers to accessing western healthcare, and yet still reported using clinics and hospitals as a last option. Findings also revealed that male migrants are climate driven, but female migrants are driven by the lack of a male provider. Hence, these results have implications for both climate-driven male migrants and financially driven female migrants. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed below.\",\n",
       "  'Emphasis on mental health': 'The trauma migrants experienced may partially explain why migrants emphasized the importance of having good mental health more than non-migrants did. Individuals tend to construct their ideal health state based on the current challenges they are facing (Gollwitzer and Oettingen 1998). Migrants felt lonely, isolated, homesick, and anxiety ridden in Arusha, which led them to place a higher importance on feeling happy and less stressed. A study of Ethiopian refugees in the UK revealed similar findings: refugees valued happiness and overall well-being much more than their non-refugee Ethiopian counterparts (Papadopoulos and Lay 2003). The study attributed this shift in health perception to the increased personal trauma and isolation faced by refugees. Similarly in this study, it is likely that difficult migration experiences resulted in poor mental health for migrants, which brought mental health to the forefront of their ideal health states.',\n",
       "  'Healthcare underutilization': \"Although reducing the social inequities and hardships that lead to these mental health problems is important in the long run, health care resources available now to migrant Maasai in Arusha could greatly improve their mental and physical well-being if more extensively utilized. Several possible explanations exist for why migrant participants used western healthcare in Arusha as a last resort and only for physical maladies. First, migrants may not have been aware of the healthcare options available to them. Arusha has many hospitals and clinics, and the Arusha Mental Health Trust provides free psychiatric health services as well as psychological counseling to underprivileged people in the city. However, new migrants may not know about these options, and therefore not utilize them. Future research needs to investigate the level of knowledge Maasai migrants have about their local healthcare options. Stigma may also be preventing migrants from mental health resources in particular. Although no research has been done on the use of mental healthcare in the Maasai population, existing research from other countries shows that both self and public stigma can prevent an individual from seeking help for mental health problems. Individuals do not want to label themselves as having a mental illness, and also do not want to receive that label from society (Corrigan 2004). Furthermore, research shows that minority ethnic groups who are already confronted with prejudice and discrimination, such as the Maasai in Arusha, suffer increased stigma when faced with mental illness (Gary 2005).\\nLastly, some participants referred to the ''cure'' for poor mental health as being improved life circumstances, such as increased wealth. Maasai may believe that healthcare treatments would not have any effect on their mental health. They perceive poor mental health as a result of stressful or negative life circumstances. The only way to feel better is to increase the quality of their everyday lives.\\nFuture research needs to investigate if, and how, these themes contribute to the underutilization of healthcare resources by Maasai migrants, thereby enhancing efforts to make available healthcare more attractive and relevant to Maasai migrants.\",\n",
       "  'Mental Health Interventions in Arusha': \"The increase in migrant mental health challenges and the emphasis migrant participants placed on mental health indicate that mental health interventions could be effective in this population. Interventions could focus on educating migrants about available mental health services, the benefits they would provide, and their accessibility.\\nAdditionally, interventions might introduce mental health services targeted directly towards the Maasai migrants in Arusha. These services could be communitybased programs, which recruit and train Maasai community members to provide psychological counseling to Maasai migrants that is both culturally and linguistically appropriate. Tsai's research on Asian Americans in the US shows that mental health services need to be tailored to the cultural perceptions of ideal mental health states, as these perceptions can differ greatly across cultures (Tsai 2007). It would also therefore be important to understand Maasai perceptions of mental health more thoroughly to formulate effective interventions.\\nMutual aid societies are a more prevention-oriented intervention. Migrant participants struggled with homesickness, loneliness, and feeling isolated. Having a formal and consistent setting in which they could go for support, and to identify and solve problems, could positively influence their mental health. Maasai men in Arusha meet every week to discuss personal, financial, and health-related problems. This meeting could be extended to all Maasai in Arusha, or a new setting, such as a community center, could be established.\",\n",
       "  'Implications for research and policy': 'Overall, the findings of this study have implications for both future science and policy. The methodology used in this study can be used to study migration, health perceptions, and help-seeking behaviors in other vulnerable populations. Specifically, future research should investigate reasons for healthcare underutilization by Maasai migrants in urban regions. Policy makers should implement appropriate interventions to improve the mental health of Maasai migrants.',\n",
       "  'Strengths and limitations': 'The thoughtful and scientifically rigorous research methodology has several strengths. First, the project had a strong community partner who integrated the researchers into the community, and enhanced the cultural acceptability of the interview protocol. Second, the migrant and non-migrant samples were matched on demographic characteristics and location. This allowed for stronger conclusions to be drawn about the influence of migration on health perceptions and help-seeking behaviors. Lastly, the study is context specific. Few existing studies have gone into this amount of depth with the Maasai population. These aspects of the study design enhanced the confidence associated with the conclusions made.\\nHowever, this study had some potential limitations. Due to limited funding, the research was a small convenience sample. The exploratory findings and implications should be further investigated and verified through research using larger and more systematic samples. Another possible limitation arose from the use of a translator. Threats to validity when using a translator exist if the translator does not have full understanding of the research project, or has biased ideas about the research (Kapborg and Bertero 2002). To address this challenge, training was conducted to familiarize the translator with the research aims and the interview protocol, and to ensure that he would translate questions verbatim during each interview. Additionally, the Maasai project coordinator periodically checked the translations to improve reliability and validity.',\n",
       "  'Conclusion': \"This case study illuminates the ways in which rural-tourban migration can influence migrant health perceptions, perceived health problems, and healthcare decisions. Given the recent refugee crisis in the European research related to migrants' individual level health perceptions and behaviors is timely and important. The climate is changing at unprecedented rates, and rates of financially driven ruralto-urban migration are climbing. Many refugee health program services are exclusively offered to political refugees, disregarding the plights of climate refugees and within-country migrants (Biermann and Boas 2010). Further research is needed to inform policies and interventions that will mitigate the impacts of increasing rural-to-urban migration in developing countries.\",\n",

       " 8: {'abstract': \"Migration is at the centre of demographic research on the populationenvironment nexus. Increasing concerns about the impacts of environmental events on human population are fuelling interest on the relationship between migration and environmental change. Using data from the Climate Change Collective Learning and Observatory Network Ghana project, we employ binary logistic regression to examine migration intentions of households in response to major community stressors including climate-related ones. The results indicate that the type of community stressor that affects households most does not differentiate migration intentions in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone: Even though the majority of the respondents mentioned climate-related events as the stressor that affects them the most, such events do not appear to directly explain migration intentions. However, socio-demographic factors such as age, household size and current migration status are significant predictors of migration intentions, with younger household heads, heads of migrant households and heads of smaller households being relatively more likely to have migration intentions than other household heads. We conclude that migration drivers are multifaceted and deserve further research because even in areas with perceived environmental stress, climate-related events may not be the primary motivation for migration intentions.\",\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"Internal migration is recognized to be an important mechanism through which the spatial distribution of people changes over time (Greenwood 1997). Migration intentions matter in the internal migration literature because intentions are the first step in the actual migration process (Macleod 1996;Van Dalen and Henkens 2008), and intentions have been found to translate into actual migration in most instances (De Jong 2000;Van Dalen et al. 2005). The use of stated preferences such as intentions has been widely used by social demographers, geographers and psychologist as opposed to the revealed preferences approach often used by economists who are interested in the actual movement of people (Borjas 1991;Hatton and Williamson 2004). The focus on internal migration intentions is important because it makes it easy to trace such migrants for follow-up surveys to check whether they have realized their intentions. Studies have shown that intentions are good predictors of actual migration even though some argue that intentions lack credibility (Constant and Massey 2002;Sutton 1998). Recent climate trends and events, and their impacts on communities, are likely to influence people's choices, and migration will be one of numerous options that will be considered.\\nThis study uses migration intentions as a proxy to measure the likelihood of future out-migration in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone. This method has been chosen because it makes it easy to understand the migration situation in this setting over a period of time. Also, validating the intentions is comparatively easy when the focus is on internal migration rather than international migration. Inferring from the 'new economies of migration' thesis (Lauby and Stark 1988;Stark 1991), households will make migration decisions in environmentally challenged settings based not only on the benefits that households stand to gain from migration but also to minimize risk associated with climate-related events. The means of minimizing risk is easily accessible in developed countries in the form of insurance markets and government programs (Massey et al. 1993), but this is difficult to achieve in some developing countries because of the poor economy or limited governance structures (Mahul and Stutley 2010). A number of developing countries' economies rely heavily on agriculture, but very few of these countries have access to crop insurance (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler 2006). Crop losses due to extreme weather events are a common phenomenon in agriculture, including losses in developing countries. An estimated 70-80 % of the losses are attributable either to a lack of rain or to an excess of moisture (either heavy rain or flooding) (Herbold 2010). Risk diversification in the event of climate-related events among poor farmers is very challenging, and migration is usually one of the numerous strategies that are used by households.\\nIn addition, the structural adjustment policies of the mid-1980s and 1990s, such as the removal of subsidies on fertilizer, health care and other social services, have seriously affected development in many parts of Ghana especially in rural communities. Farmers generally were not able to buy fertilizers to increase their yields and therefore decided to move into non-agriculture sectors with migrant farmers being the most affected population (Amanor and Pabi 2007). Also, as a result of the liberalization of land tenure systems and land reforms in 1990s, there has been increasing land tenure insecurity for women, migrant farmers and young people (Awumbila and Tsikata 2010). In some cases, the longer a settler stays in the community, the more he or she is viewed as a community member and the less restriction that may be imposed on his/her agricultural land use rights (Kasanga and Kotey 2001). However, because of population growth in the transition zone and the high demand for land for agriculture, it is usually difficult for non-indigenes to have less restriction on land use. Indigenes impose rules on share-cropping that typically restrict non-indigenes from cultivating economic plants such as cocoa and palm trees on their land since that takes a longer time to mature and also brings about complications when the indigene wants to take the land away from the non-indigene (Adjei-Nsiah 2006).\\nOverall, internal migration trends in sub-Saharan Africa are significant. Ruralurban migration accounted for roughly half of urban growth in Africa between the 1960s and 1990s (Zachariah and Conde 1981;Kelley 1991;Lall and Shalizi 2006). It is estimated that 36 % of sub-Saharan Africa's population lives in urban areas (World Urbanization Prospects: The 2011 Revision). An estimated 50-80 % of rural households in sub-Saharan Africa have at least one migrant member (DFID 2004). Considerable demographic literature on internal migration in sub-Saharan Africa discusses the characteristics of people who are more likely to move (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) 2005; Byass et al. 2003;Gibson and Gurmu 2012). However, these findings may not extend to the relationship between climate-related events and the intention to migrate. The impact of climate-related events could bring about varying results at the household level. This is an issue that affects everyone and receives very complex responses from both poor and rich households based on the resources available to them and the type of climate event that is being experienced (Foresight 2011). Increasing concerns about the impact of climaterelated environmental events on human population further fuel the interest on how to explain the relationship between environmental change and migration (UNFPA 2009;Van der Geest 2011).\\nMigration has a long-standing tradition in Ghana. Every ethnic group in Ghana claims to have migrated from somewhere else within the region to its current location (Anarfi et al., 2003). It is estimated that about 25 % of migratory moves in Ghana are rural-urban (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) 2008). The reasons behind most of these migrations are usually to join a family, to find a better environment and also for economic activities (Songsore 2009;Van der Geest 2011). In West Africa, there are well-established patterns of seasonal migration from the northern regions of countries such as Ghana, Togo, Mali and Burkina Faso to destinations in the south such as cocoa farms (Sharp et al., 2003). These seasonal migrations are influenced by the differences in the ecological zones, as the north is usually dry for most of the year while the southern regions typically experience a substantial wet period throughout the year. As a result, the southern part of Ghana tends to be a net receiver of migrants, and the northern part is known as a net supplier of migrants (GSS 2005). The decision to migrate in some instance is partly the result of the goods, or capital return migrants are able to bring home, which motivate others from their communities to migrate (Kwankye et al. 2009). Females from northern parts of Ghana for instance embark on migration in order to acquire the basic things that will enable them to get married (Opare 2003). Also, one study on north-south migration in Ghana concludes that migration decisions were not ascribed to sudden onset of environmental stress and that environmental pull of more easily accessible arable land in the south appears to be at least as important as environmental push (Van der Geest 2011). Overall, current research suggests that socio-demographic and economic factors are the dominant drivers of internal migration.\\nIn recent times, internal migration has been used as a livelihood strategy in environmentally vulnerable rural communities in Ghana (Kwankye et al. 2009). The relationship between environmental events and migration has been established empirically in other contexts-although the relationship is not a linear one-and varies according to other migration 'push' and 'pull' factors. In southwest Mexico, declining rainfall has been associated with rising migration to the United States, since many rural communities depend on rain-fed agriculture (Munshi 2003); however, a second study in the drought-prone Mexican states of Zacatecas and Durango found the opposite: that decreasing rainfall correlated with lower rates of international migration (Kniveton et al. 2008). Findings from studies in Burkina Faso (Beauchemin and Schoumaker 2005) and Mali (Findley 1994) revealed that droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were associated with decreases in international, long-distance migration, while short-distance migration to larger agglomerations increased during drought years. However, climate-related stressors are just one of the stressors people in the West Africa region experience. There are no studies on how climate-related stressors as part of the general stressors of a community affect migration intentions. Examining climate-related stressors as part of the general stressors will help policy makers to understand the contribution of climate-related stressors to internal migration and to develop policies that will address the challenges of climate-related stressors.\\nThis paper examines internal migration intentions of respondents in two rural agricultural communities (Bouko and Bofie-Banda) in the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana where their source of livelihood is affected by environmental stress. In this paper, we address three research questions: (1) Do household heads in the forestsavannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as a major community stressor? (2) Do household heads in the forest-savannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as the stressor of greatest concern? (3) Are household heads who perceive climate-related events as the stressor of greatest concern more likely to intend to migrate than household heads that do not? The two communities provide different environmental contexts in which to study migration intentions. Bouko is located in a dry, semi-deciduous forest, while Bofie-Banda is located in a wooded savannah grassland (Fig. 1). The Bouko community has in recent times experienced the establishment of stone quarry companies in the community, which serve as an alternative source of livelihood for local people while there is no such development in Bofie-Banda. Buoku is also located on the main Sunyani-Wenchi highway, which makes it possible for farmers to sell their produce to the travelling public. Bofie-Banda on the other hand is located about 17 km from the Wenchi-Sampa road but has currently seen a lot of vehicular movements because of the construction of the Bui power dam which is about 22 km from the community. In terms of marketing of farm produce, people in Bofie-Banda transport their produce to either Nsawkaw or Wenchi for sale.\\nWhy focus on the forest-savannah transition zone?\\nIn terms of agriculture, Ghana has five distinct agroecological zones, namely rainforest, forest-savannah transition, guinea savannah, Sudan savannah and coastal savannah. These zones are characterized by distinct rainfall regimes and as a result support specific crops. The forest-savannah transition zone in Ghana has been the focus of policies addressing environmental issues over the past two decades because it is particularly vulnerable to climate-related environmental events that negatively impact agriculture (Afikorah-Danquah 2009). The forest-savannah transition zone is one of the food baskets of Ghana and has been a major destination for migrants from the comparatively arid Sudan savannah regions of Ghana (GSS 2005). There are two different vegetation characteristics in the transition zone, and so communities in the region experience different types of environmental conditions.\\nEcologically, the southern part of the transition zone largely comprises dry semi-deciduous forest, while the northern part consists of a mosaic of gallery forests and forest patches in more-or-less wooded savannah grassland. The soils in the forest-savannah transition zone are generally sandy in texture and have low effective water retention capacity, and nutrients leach easily if not well managed (Adjei-Nsiah 2006). This has resulted in soil impoverishments in some parts of the region, particularly where the soils are light textured surface horizons with clay pans appearing in shallow depths (MOFA 1998). Against these challenges, a recent study in the region has shown widespread presence of highly fertile anthropogenic dark earth soils, similar to Amazonian terra preta, yet subject to continuing production and use (Leach et al. 2012). The little known practice of soil enrichment, though largely absent from common narratives of land degradation in the transition zone, points to a long history of relatively sophisticated indigenous farming practices.\\nHowever, the population in the transition zone has grown over the years, and this has equally had an impact on the land. According to the 2000 population census, the transition zone had a population density of 46 people per square kilometre, which is the third lowest in Ghana in terms of regions. However, population densities are unevenly distributed within the transition zone, with a much higher population density of 109 people per square kilometre in the forest portion of the area and a thin population density of 22 people per square kilometre in the savannah portion (GSS 2005). This presupposes that there is widely available land in the savannah portion to migrant farmers from the northern part of Ghana at relatively cheap terms but in a difficult environment to succeed (Amanor and Pabi 2007). Farmers, especially in the forest portion of the transition zone, could no longer practice bush-fallow system of farming because of limited land (Codjoe and Bilsborrow 2011). This condition presents farmers in the transition zone with limited arable lands for their farming activities, which has serious implications for food security in Ghana as a whole.\\nEnvironmental trends are exacerbating the already challenging economic, social and health issues confronting the populations in the forest-savannah transition zone and are obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing poverty by half by the year 2015 (Adjei-Nsiah 2006). According to the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) report on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment in 2008, cocoa production will be seriously affected by the impact of climatic events and the ramification of this on the social and economic life of individuals, communities and Ghana as a whole will be very significant. Cocoa is a major cash crop in Ghana and a significant contributor to its Gross National Product (GSS 2008). Initial qualitative study in Buoku indicates that farmers in the community used to cultivate cocoa on a larger scale four decades ago but because of the irregular rainfall and rampant bush fires, few of the farmers currently have cocoa plantation. The irregular trend of rainfall in the area does not support cocoa production, which was formerly a major cash crop for the people.\\nToday, environmental change, including climate-related events, presents a new threat to human survival and a new situation for migration (Adger et al. 2001). However, there is still little understanding of how climate-related environmental events will contribute to migration, net of the traditional determinants of migration. Ghana continues to experience significant rural-urban migration (GSS 2005), although the rate of migration has declined over the years, and it is also lower compared to many African countries. Environmental events could be spurring the increase in rural-urban migration, at least in part, as members of agricultural communities are moving into non-agricultural settings in search of alternative sources of livelihood (Marchetta 2008;Van der Geest 2011).\",\n",
       "  'Climate-related events and internal migration intentions': \"The relationship between climate-related events and migration intentions is complex. It is difficult to distinguish individuals for whom environmental factors are the sole motivation for migration. In other words, the fact that people are migrating in most cases cannot be solely attributed to environmental factors. Thus, it is important to consider the general stressors people go through in a place and to find out whether the type of stressor experienced differentiates migration intentions. Despite these complexities, Myers (2002) predicts that there will be more than 200 million environmental refugees by 2050. His article was cited by a number of subsequent publications as the best estimate of the number of people who will be displaced due to the adverse effects of climate-related events (Friends of the Earth 2007; Christian Aid 2007;Stern 2007;Global Humanitarian Forum 2009). However, this estimate has been criticized as 'guesswork' owing to the assumptions of its methodology (Castles 2002(Castles , 2011;;Brown 2008;Gemenne 2011;Foresight 2011). There are several factors that drive migration, and climatic events are just one of these. Also, because climatic events are linked to the environmental, economic and socio-political factors that also drive migration, it is difficult to identify individuals for whom climatic factors are the sole reason for migrating. It is important to take into account other factors when investigating whether people in low-income countries will migrate as a result of climate-related events.\\nThus, environmental factors cannot be easily disentangled from the rest of the social, economic and political factors and processes leading to out-migration (Lonergan 1998). With the exception of sudden environmental disasters, migration is just one among several possible responses and adaptations to environmental changes (Adger et al. 2007). People's subjective view and perception of climate hazards and their own vulnerability to climate variability are other factors related to migration decisions (Izazola et al. 1998;Hunter 2005). It is, however, difficult to tell whether such decisions are made based on climate-related stressors or the social and economic challenges that people have to grapple with. Psychologically, people who have experienced a particular event over a long period of time may perceive it as a 'normal' event and thus may not turn to migration as a response (Kasperson and Kasperson 2005). In other words, people may develop a psychological thinking that enables them to cope with environmental hardships. The intention to migrate is more likely to arise as a result of the social and economic difficulties that are exacerbated by climate-related environmental events. Therefore, it is important to examine these other stressors together with climate-related stressors to see whether they yield different effects on migration intentions.\\nEnvironmental events such as floods and droughts can serve as an immediate push while long-term changes such as desertification can lead to a decline in living standards that increases the cost of staying versus leaving (Adamo 2003). In sum, the severity of environmental stresses can force people to adapt to adverse situations by employing many kinds of adaptation measures (Codjoe et al. 2012 andCodjoe andOwusu 2011). Internal migration is a livelihood strategy for many households in rural Ghana as a result of poor agricultural yields (GSS 2005). For example, rural families often encourage young men and women to migrate to the urban centres in order to send remittances home and to reduce household size (Van der Geest 2004). In other cases, rural farmers migrate from the north of the country to the transitional zone, where arable land is less scarce (Van der Geest 2011). We suspect that climate-related environmental events will increase migration from affected environments by those who have the ambition or resources to move and as a result may leave most of these areas with particularly vulnerable (or 'trapped') populations.\\nThe risk of being affected by environmental impacts is the interaction between climate-related events and the underlying social vulnerability of the population. Social vulnerability in this sense is viewed as the socio-demographic characteristics of households such as age, household size and migration status that make them relatively vulnerable to climate-change-related events. Also, migration decisions in response to climatic impacts are likely to be influenced by community stressors. To better understand these associations, this study focuses on salient stressors of households including climate-related ones and how these differently influence migration intentions in rural agricultural communities in the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana.\",\n",
       "  'Data and method': \"The data for the study are part of series of data collected by members of the Climate Change Collective Learning and Observatory Network Ghana (CCLONG) project in the two communities in the transition zone from 2007 to 2009. Two of the authors were part of the CCLONG project team. 1 The CCLONG Project had four main objectives: (1) to assess perceptions of climate change and other threats among farmers, extension agents, researchers and policy makers as well as determinants of adaptive capacity and decision-making for adaptation; (2) adjust climate forecasts, carbon measurements and modelling to place-specific needs; (3) encourage social learning and risk communication for adaptation and resilience; and (4) identify land use and management practices, socio-economic strategies and institutional arrangements that enhance carbon uptake and storage (mitigation) and contribute to more resilient livelihoods and ecosystems (adaptation).\\nThe CCLONG team conducted a household survey in the two selected communities (Bouko and Bofie-Banda) in 2009. The communities were selected because they both fall in the forest-savannah transition zone but have different environmental histories that have over the years influenced the type of crops that are cultivated by farmers. Both communities used to have forest vegetation with the majority of farmers cultivating cocoa, maize and rice. However, changes in rainfall trends over the past four decades, coupled with droughts causing bush fires, have influenced agricultural activities in the transition zone. For example, farmers in Bofie-Banda have stopped producing maize, which is generally a staple food and a major cash crop in the transition zone, because the pattern of rainfall in the area did not support maize cultivation anymore. Additionally, the CCLONG team had indepth information of the communities because they had been collecting qualitative data in the communities for over 2 years. Survey respondents were randomly selected using a household listing completed by students of the University for Development Studies (Tamale, Ghana) in 2008. A total of 200 households representing more than 50 % of households in the communities were selected and visited for the study. All the 200 selected households participated in the study. Approximately 100 households were interviewed in each of the communities. Also, the households in the study communities are homogenous in character with about 98 % of them being farmers. However, the establishment of stone quarry companies in Bouko in 2010 could serve as alternative source of livelihood to the people.\\nThe questionnaire was administered to heads of household. Household heads were chosen because of the role they play in decision-making in the study settings. They typically have the final say in major household decisions. There were instances in some of the qualitative studies in the communities where household heads did not practically contribute anything to household income but were recognized by household members as the ones responsible for making household financial decisions. Household heads are thus held in high esteem, and issues confronting families are usually discussed at that level before it is taken to higher levels like the chief palace in instances where there is no compromise among the parties. With regard to migration decision-making processes, individual household members who have the intent to migrate typically need the approval of the head of the household to be able to embark on a good journey. Further, in order to measure the social vulnerability of households to environmental events, a combination of household head characteristics and general household information was used. These included the household head's age, sex, educational level, marital status, as well as the present migration status of household, household size and household income. These factors are influential in amplifying or reducing overall vulnerability to hazards (Blaikie 1994;Hewitt 1997).\\nThe validity of these variables is tested in the study, but they are assumed to be relevant to this study for the reasons outlined below. Firstly, the age of household head determines the security of younger household members in times of climaterelated hazards. Older household heads may not migrate in most instances because of the attachments they have to their communities as compared to younger household heads. Thus, older household heads preserve the traditions of the household and help in the upbringing of children even if some members are going to migrate. Younger household heads may in most instances migrate with the entire family as compared to older household heads who may select some members of the household to migrate. Also, because of the land tenure system in the area and the power that is given to male household heads, female-headed households may not have access to alternative sources of livelihood in a community where men control most of the resources. Individual members in female-headed households are therefore more likely to suffer as a result of climate-related events compared to households headed by males. In addition, the educational level of the head of the household plays an important role in the welfare of the household and also determines the level of information available to the household and their capacity to prepare towards climate-related events. All things being equal, household heads with higher level of education are expected to be more knowledgeable than household heads with lower level of education in times of climate-related events because education provides people with a lot of options in times of difficulties.\\nSecondly, the marital status of the household head also helps to determine the level of vulnerability of the household. People who are married tend to have more extended relations coming to their aid in times of climate-related events than those who are not married and so may be limited to just their immediate family. Those who are not married on the other hand could easily migrate without having to worry about kin relations like those who are married. Thus, unmarried people are able to take quick decisions in times of climate-related hazards in comparison with married people. The size of the household also determines how the household will be able to manage in times of climate-related events. The larger the household size, the more vulnerable they may be compared to smaller household size in times of a disaster because the needs of a larger household will be difficult to provide for compared to a smaller one where just a few people have to be attended to. On the other hand, larger households might be able to more easily diversify their income by sending one of their members elsewhere for cash labour without losing essential household labour. Finally, the current migration status of the household head determines how attached the household is to the community and the resources that the household could enjoy in the community. All things being equal, non-migrant households have greater access to land and kin relations than migrant households and so may be less affected by climate-related events compared to migrant households. However, when a migrant is married to an indigenous person, he or she stands to benefit from the properties owned by the partner. There are also instances where the length of stay of a migrant in a community could give him/her similar privileges similar to those of non-migrants. Also, income plays a major role in the migration decision process. In an environmentally challenged setting, household income may help facilitate the migration process in a household. Households that have the financial resources will be able to sponsor members to embark on migration while those who do not have the financial resources may resort to other ways of coping with the situation.\",\n",
       "  'Dependent variable': \"The dependent variable in the study was migration intentions. Household heads were asked, 'Do you intend to move from this community in the next 5 years?' The question sought to identify household heads who intended to migrate from the community and stay in their new location continuously for 6 months and beyond. Households that indicated 'yes' were those who have the intention to migrate while those who said otherwise were classified as those who have no migration intentions.\",\n",
       "  'Independent variable': \"The independent variable used in the model was the stressor that household heads indicated affected them most in the study communities. First, household heads with assistance from other members of the household listed all the major stressors that affect them in the community. All respondents were prompted once with regard to this particular question. Second, still with inputs from other household members, the stressors in an order of how they should be addressed were ranked. Third, household heads scored the severity of the stressor. The study used cowpea seeds for the severity score because some of the respondents were illiterate. Participants scored each stressor with the seeds bearing in mind that the number of seeds placed on a particular stressor is a measure of the severity of that stressor. The scoring ranged from zero to five. A score of zero is an indication that that particular stressor in the community has no impact on the respondents' household while a score of five is an indication that it is a stressor that affects them most. Thus, lower scores relate to no or mild impacts, and higher scores relate to severe impacts on households. The severity of each major community stressor as scored in the household was used in the regression model as the main independent variables. We treated the stressors in the model independently but discussed the stressors as climate-related or nonclimate-related. Thus, irregular rainfall and bush fire were considered as climaterelated stressors. This is because our prior focus group discussions in the communities revealed that individuals in the area perceive irregular rainfall and bush fires as climate-related events.2 \",\n",
       "  'Control variables': \"We controlled for household size, household income, age, sex, marital status, migration status and level of education of household head, which are known to influence internal migration intentions (Anarfi et al. 2003;Kwankye et al. 2009). Age is categorized into four groups in conformity with the classification of youth in rural Ghana as those aged 18 years and above but less than 30 years. Those aged 30-39 and 40-49 years are classified as those in their middle age, while those aged 50 years and above are classified as the elderly in the communities. Marital status is categorized into those married/cohabiting and those not in unions. Education is categorized as those with primary or lower education and those with junior high or higher certificate. There were very few respondents with a secondary or higher education, and so these were combined with those with junior high education. The size of the household was equally categorized into three groupings. We combined single individual households with households with two members because the two may not be very different in how they are affected by climate-related events. We therefore grouped household size into those with: (1) less than three members; (2) three to five member households; and (3) households with six or more members. We classified households of six members as larger households because the current average household size for rural forest in Ghana is approximately five members (GSS 2008).\\nHousehold income was classified into two groups: those who earn an annual household income of GH₵ 2,000, which is approximately equivalent to the annual minimum wage in Ghana, and those who earn above GH₵ 2,000. We grouped household income into two categories because most of the household had an annual income of just a little over GH₵ 1,000 and the maximum household income that was reported was about GH₵ 2,500. Income levels in the study area are low, and there is little variation in income among households. However, migrant households typically have higher income than non-migrant households because they put the piece of land available to them into maximum use by applying fertilizer and other chemicals on their crops to ensure that they get enough harvest to be able to achieve their migration objectives. With regard to sex, we distinguished between households that had females as their head and those that had males as their head because of some cultural privileges that individuals enjoy in the transition zone based on their gender. Finally, we classified current migration status of households into those who are currently migrants in the community and those who are not. We took into consideration respondents' place of birth and whether they are natives of the community or not. Generally, non-migrants or indigenous people of the community have access to agriculture lands that can only be acquired by migrants through leasing, marriage or a long period of stay in the community (Adjei-Nsiah 2006).\",\n",
       "  'Analytic approach': 'To examine what type of climate-related environmental events may trigger internal migration intentions, a binary logistic regression was employed to handle the dichotomous dependent variable. Two models were run for the study. The first model examined the relationship between stressors and migration intentions in the transition zone. The second model examined how households who scored climaterelated stressors as the most severe differ in migration intentions from those who scored other stressors highest controlling for covariates. The level of significance for interpreting the results is p \\\\ 0.05.',\n",
       "  'Results': '',\n",
       "  'Descriptive statistics': \"Table 1 shows the distribution of major community stressors in the forest-savannah transition zone in 2009. The results indicate that household heads in the forestsavannah transition zone are experiencing quite a number of challenges. Climaterelated events (irregular rainfall and bush fire) are among the major stressors mentioned by household heads. Of the 200 sampled households, more than twothirds (70 %) of the respondents indicated that irregular rainfall is a major stressor in the transition zone. In addition, 26 % out of the 200 sampled households mentioned poverty as a major stressor, while 13 and 20 % mentioned poor health services and unemployment, respectively. With regard to education, respondents were concerned about poor formal educational attainment in the community. Other stressors mentioned, such as land disputes, teenage pregnancy, stealing and gross disrespect of elders by the youth, are not shown in Table 1.\\nIn terms of ranking of the community stressors, more than half (51 %) of households ranked irregular rainfall as the most concerned stressor followed by unemployment (22 %) and then poverty (16 %). The least ranked community stressor among the seven is poor health services. In scoring the stressors in terms of severity, irregular rainfall had the highest average severity score of 3.7, followed by bush fire (3.4) and poor soil fertility (3.2). Even though unemployment was the second highest ranked stressor in the communities, its severity score is lower than bush fire and poor soil fertility, which were ranked fifth and sixth, respectively. We argue that it is the severity of the stressors that creates problems for households and the climate-related variables (irregular rainfall and bush fire) received higher severity scores. The intention to migrate from the communities in the next 5 years came up strongly among the respondents. Table 2 shows that more than half (54 %) of the respondents had intention to migrate in the next 5 years. Household heads in the study communities (where the average age was 41.4 years) are, on average, younger than the national average age (46.3 years) for rural Ghana (GSS 2008). There are more male household heads than female household heads in the transition zone, and this is consistent with national statistics where about 71 % of household heads are males (GSS 2008). There are very low levels of education in the study communities. A little over half (51 %) of the respondents had attained junior high school or senior high school education with the remaining having attained primary or lower education. These low levels of education will make respondents less competitive in the formal sector of the economy, and so they may be limited to the informal sector, which does not provide much security for households' well-being in times of climate-related hazards. As expected, nearly two-thirds (64 %) of household heads were married or cohabiting, while the remaining were not part of a union. Household heads are supposed to lead a responsible life and are expected in most rural settings in Ghana to be individuals who are married and command some respect in the community.\\nIn addition, on average, households have approximately five members, which is higher than the national average of 4.1 for rural forest areas but a little lower than the national average of 5.4 members for rural savannah zones (GSS 2008). Generally, income levels are low in the transition zone. Nearly half (48 %) of the respondents in the communities had an annual income below the national minimum wage. Poverty is pronounced in rural Ghana, and about a quarter (25 %) of the population of Ghana lives below the poverty line (GSS 2005). In addition, the current migration status of the household often determines how decisions regarding migration are made. For current migrant households, they could have migration intentions when their expectations at place of destination are not met. This is because, currently, migrant household heads may not have so much attachment to the community compared to those who are non-migrants. That said currently migrant households are challenged in terms of finance to accomplish such migration intentions. Table 2 indicates that a little over half (52 %) of the respondents are currently non-migrants while the remaining are migrants.\",\n",
       "  'Association between climate-related events and internal migration intentions': \"The bivariate association between the major community stressors as mentioned by household heads and the intention to migrate is examined in Table 3. The results indicate that more than half of the respondents who mentioned some of the community stressors as a concern to them did not have the intention to migrate. Also, on average, over two-fifth of the respondents who did not mention any of the community stressors as a concern to them indicated that they have the intention to migrate. The decision to migrate therefore depends on several factors, and it is difficult to say that people are migrating from a particular community as a result of a single factor. The analysis shows that even in a very diverse environmental setting like the forest-savannah transition zone, where the impact of climate-related events is known to be impacting on people's livelihood (Afikorah-Danquah 2009), quite a number of household heads do not have the intention to migrate. Apart from bush fire, which has a statistical association with migration intentions in the forestsavannah transition zone, none of the other major stressors mentioned by the respondents have statistical association with intention to migrate. Thus, one of the climate-related variables (bush fire) was statistically associated with migration intention at the bivariate level, while irregular rainfall was not. With regard to other explanatory variables, age, marital status, household size and migration status were statistically associated with migration intentions, while sex, level of education and income were not statistically associated with migration intentions. Even though most of the major community stressors were not associated with migration intentions, we sought to find out at the multivariate level whether there is a relationship between most severe stressors and intentions to migrate in the transition zone. Turning to multivariate analyses, the results in Model 1 in Table 4 indicate that the most concerned community stressors only explain about 6 % of the variations in the intention to migrate in the transition zone. In Model 2, however, when the sociodemographic factors are controlled, the model explains about 41 % of the variations in the intention to migrate in the transition zone. This is an indication of the strong role socio-demographic factors play in intentions to migrate in the transition zone. This is not different from other studies on migration where socio-demographic factors played important role in the migration decision process and the type of people who finally migrate (De Jong 2000;Anarfi et al. 2003). Climate-related events are tied to socio-demographic factors in the migration decision process with a higher influence on the intention to migrate emanating from socio-demographic indicators. Also, household heads who mentioned bush fire as the stressor that affects them most in the transition zone are significantly more likely to report migration intentions (Model 1). This implies that a unit increase in household's perceived severity score of bush fire will lead to an increase in migration intentions in the household by 0.032. Bush fire is associated with drought in the transition zone, and the gradual changes in the seasonal nature of agriculture in the transition zone as a result of the occurrence of some of these events may render respondents unemployed for some period of the year. Household heads affected by bush fire are more likely to migrate to other places where they can have some employment. The association between bush fire as a stressor that affects households most and migration intentions does not hold after controlling for household heads' sociodemographic factors (Model 2). Model 2 includes socio-demographic characteristics to ascertain whether the associations in Model 1 are robust. Once socio-demographic factors are controlled, there is no significant association between any of the climate-related stressors that affect household heads most and the intention to migrate in the forest-savannah transition zone. Unemployment as a most concerned stressor in the forest-savannah transition zone predicts migration intentions at this point. The results indicate that a unit increase in household heads' perceived severity score of unemployment will result in an increase in migration intentions by 0.380. Non-migrant households are significantly less likely to report migration intentions compared to migrant households. Household heads who are aged 40-49 years are significantly more likely to have migration intentions in their household compared to those aged 20-29 years (Model 2).\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions': \"Migration intentions are influenced by social, economic, demographic and environmental factors. In this study, rainfall is essential for the livelihood of the study populations, which depend on rain-fed agriculture. Environmental events challenge people's livelihoods, which are directly linked to their social and economic well-being. The complex nature of these relationships demands a thorough investigation of the environmental, socio-demographic and economic factors that trigger migration intentions. To understand how community stressors including climate-related stressors predict migration intentions, we considered stressors that affect respondents most in the study communities, the sociodemographic and economic situation of the people, and the agroecological area in which they are located.\\nOur results indicate that the majority of household heads in the forest-savannah transition zone perceive climate-related events as their most pressing stressor. This is so because agriculture, which is the main livelihood of the people, depends on rainfall. Irregular rainfall and bush fires will therefore make it difficult for them to harvest enough from their farming activities. This is consistent with other studies in the transition zone that indicate a dramatic change in the rainfall pattern in the area (Asiamah et al. 2000;Adjei-Nsiah 2006). Also, household heads in the transition zone perceive climate-related events as the most salient stressors confronting them. More than half (56.5 %) of the respondents mentioned climate-related events as the stressor that affects them most. We equally found that more than half of the respondents in the transition zone had the intention to migrate which could potentially impact food production in the region-although the present study did not probe where migrants planned to move (which could include, for example, other rural areas within the region, urban centres or returning to their communities of origin in northern Ghana). The transition zone has some of the major food markets in Ghana because of high food production in the area. The Techiman food market for instance is patronized by people from neigbouring countries such as Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. Also, food produced in the transition zone, especially yam and maize, is transported to other parts of Ghana by market women. This has helped us to address food shortage situations in some parts of northern Ghana, especially during the dry periods in the north when food production is very low. Thus, the migration of farmers from the transition zone will have major consequences for food security and requires some urgent attention from policy makers to address what is driving these people to have such intentions.\\nHowever, apart from unemployment in our study, the other type of stressors that affect people most, including climate-related events, does not differentiate migration intentions in the transition zone after controlling for socio-demographic and economic factors that influence migration decisions. In fact, socio-demographic factors were found to be the main predictors of intentions to migrate in the forestsavannah transition zone. Thus, older household heads in the transition zone significantly report lower migration intentions compared to younger household heads. This is consistent with the migration literature where people in younger age groups are most likely to embark on migration compared to those in older age groups (Hughes and McCormick 1985;Lam 2006;GSS 2008;White and Subedi 2008).\\nIn addition, non-migrant household heads in the study area are significantly less likely to report migration intentions than migrant household heads because of the attachment non-migrants have to their community and the resources available to them. In the forest-savannah transition zone for instance, non-migrants are the custodians of the farmland, and so they rent the land to migrant households based on share-cropping arrangements (Amanor 2002;Adjei-Nsiah 2006). The sharecropping practice in this setting is in two forms-Abusa and Abunu. Abusa was formerly the dominant share arrangement, which was based on division into thirds. Under this arrangement, one could be employed to weed and manage an already established farm or plantation in exchange for a third of the yield. Also, an abusa tenant can gain access to land and in return provide the landlord a third of the yield. This system has been replaced with the half share system (abunu) in which a landlord commands a half share as land has become scarcer. The landlords, who are mostly the indigenous people, enter into share contracts with settler farmers in order to make maximum benefit from their resources and also to have control over the land. In this regard, non-migrant households do not go through so much difficulty because they rely on what migrant households will harvest at the end of the farming season (World Bank 2003). Migrants on the other hand exert a lot of pressure on the land in order to have good harvest under the share-cropping system, and if they are not able to harvest much, they are likely to migrate to a different place (Amanor 1993;Codjoe and Bilsborrow 2012). It is also important to mention that migrants are typically less tied to their communities of residence and thus can more easily decide to embark on migration than non-migrants (Nogle 1996;Levitt 2004).\\nUnemployment is the only community stressor that predicts migration intentions because of the limited options in employment in the study communities. The other salient community stressors mentioned by household heads, including climaterelated events, do not differentiate migration intentions probably as a result of people's perceptions about the efficacy of coping resources that they may be using to address these challenges, which have not been explored in this study. As already mentioned, the share-cropping system in the transition zone may be a valuable resource to non-migrants in times of climate-related events but may make year-onyear livelihood outcomes for migrant households difficult. The resources available to non-migrants may help them cope with the situation while migrants are most likely to migrate because of inadequate resources. Also, the growth of the population in the forest portion of the transition zone means that individual households may not have large land tracts to rent some out to migrant households. In this regard, if farmers will have to cultivate different types of crops on a piece of land because of the unpredictable nature of the rains, then migrant households will be limited in their options because they will not have access to enough land to do this. The practice of multicropping generally has been used in some parts of Ghana as a strategy to diversify risk and also overcome land constraints. However, migrants typically do not practice multicropping because the strategy requires more than one growing season and it is difficult to pursue under the share-cropping rules.\\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that migrant households are more likely to have migration intentions than non-migrant households in Ghana's forest-savannah transition zone. The contribution of migrants to their host communities is, however, very significant. In the agricultural sector for instance, migrants play a crucial role in providing farm labour (Fisher et al. 2004) and also contribute significantly to food production. With the system of land tenure in Africa coupled with recent climatic impacts, the contribution of migrants to the agricultural sector could be negatively affected. Migrants may not have enough land to undertake farming, and their productivity could also be low because of the impact of climate change on crops. In this sense, the direction of migrants may be towards urban places where they could get alternative jobs that are different from agriculture. On the other hand, our study suggests established indigenous people are more likely to stay because of their attachment to the community and the resources they have. However, the extent to which these people will be committed to stay in the community has not been rigorously tested in this study, and this is an area that needs to be examined in future studies. For instance, when there is high demand on the same family land from the youngest generation of household members, it will be difficult for everybody to receive a fair share. In such situations, will some members consider migrating? And, if so, what will be the implications for food production in the transition zone? These are critical issues that need research attention.\\nThe forest-savannah transition zone has high rates of in-migrants and outmigrants. The study also reveals high migration intentions in the area. It is, however, not clear whether this trend of migration intentions pertains specifically to the communities examined or whether this is symptomatic of wider trends within the transition zone more broadly. It is also unclear from the current study whether members of established households other than the household head are engaging in migration-another issue that deserves further research and could potentially impact the livelihoods of household members who stay behind. In short, our study finding that socio-demographic factors are greater predictors of migration intentions than whether households report being affected by climate-related events supports existing research that suggests that climate change's impact on migration trends will be influenced by existing drivers of migration, including economic and social ones (Foresight 2011).\"},\n",
       " 9: {'abstract': 'We analyse whether Tanzanian rural households engage in internal migration as a response to weather-related shocks. We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.',\n",
       "  'Introduction': \"There is a substantial evidence that climate has been changing in recent decades, both in terms of its means and extremes, and this trend will not only persist, but will intensify in the near future (IPCC, 2007). According to recent estimates, this unprecedented climate variability will first occur in the tropics and among low-income countries, where the projected mean climate may continuously move outside the bounds of historical variability already in 2034, about 17 years earlier than the global average (Mora et al., 2013). Through their implications for agricultural production, these changes will exert additional pressure on populations in developing countries, both because a majority of the poor rely on rain-fed agriculture and because the share of food in their budget may amount to two-thirds (Cranfield, Eales, Hertel, & Preckel, 2003). Therefore, climate change and climate variability should be perceived as an important source of risk for rural households in developing countries.\\nThe link between climate and agricultural productivity has been thoroughly analysed. Despite calibration caveats or data limitations, both crop growth simulation models and statistical studies reveal that whereas some yield gains are likely under global warming in temperate regions, the lowest income countries will experience the sharpest losses (Deryng, Sacks, Barford, & Ramankutty, 2011). In particular, cereals, the staple food in most of the developing world, show the greatest potential to be adversely affected by climate change (Schlenker & Roberts, 2009) and according to Schlenker and Lobell (2010), yields will decline by about 10 per cent by 2050 in nearly all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) identified a threshold at 30°C for maize, after which additional increments to temperature result in a sharp reduction in yields. This type of nonlinearity can therefore have important consequences should the climate change lead to an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme heat events (Easterling et al., 2000).\\nEven though the implications of climate anomalies may have a much broader range than distortions of crop output, we focus our attention on weather variability as a risk factor in agriculture. In particular, we investigate the extent to which rural households engage in internal migration to ensure against agricultural weather-related risk.\\nThe literature suggests a range of mechanisms that households living in risky environments have developed to shield their consumption from risk, including income smoothing, self-insurance, and social insurance arrangements, particularly important in the absence of formal insurance or credit markets. Much emphasis has been put on households depleting their productive assets (Fafchamps, Udry, & Czukas, 1998;Kazianga & Udry, 2006), making low-risk, low-return investments (Rosenzweig & Binswanger, 1993), diversifying their income sources (Dercon, 1996) or diversifying landholdings into various spatially separated plots and into various crops (Townsend, 1994). However, these studies point towards limited effectiveness of risk-bearing institutions in protecting consumption against income shocks both over time and within local communities (Kazianga & Udry, 2006). The effectiveness of these risk-bearing institutions is hindered by the fact that weather risk is spatially covariant. Therefore, even though some of these mechanisms may be useful in case of idiosyncratic risk, they may not be effective when the whole village experiences the same climatic stress.\\nIn this context, we hypothesise that households exposed to increased weather risk may consider migration as spatial diversification of income. Since interhousehold family transfers are an important source of insurance in low-income countries, a household, as long as it can afford the cost of migration, may decide to relocate one or more members in order to reduce the correlation between origin and destination income shocks (Rosenzweig & Stark, 1989). Therefore, a better understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of migration as a risk management strategy may inform us about households' ability to adapt to weather-related risk, and, potentially, inform policy design in the context of increasing occurrence and intensity of climatic stress in developing countries.\\nA growing literature has investigated the use of migration as a response to climate change or climate variability. Starting with Rosenzweig and Stark's (1989) seminal paper on India, some evidence of environmentally induced migration has been found for both low-income (Ezra & Kiros, 2001;Findley, 1994;Henry, Schoumaker, & Beauchemin, 2004;Meze-Hausken, 2000) and high-income countries (Feng, Krueger, & Oppenheimer, 2010;McLeman & Smit, 2006).\\nHowever, the environmentally induced migration is a highly contextual phenomenon, depending on particular agroecological conditions or cultural norms, as in the case of female migration (Curran & Rivero-Fuentes, 2003), and therefore different studies produce different, sometimes conflicting, results. For example, Gray and Bilsborrow (2013) emphasise the importance of international migration as a response to agricultural shocks in Ecuador, whereas Findley (1994) and Henry et al. (2004) suggest that in West Africa, migrants choose short-distance destinations. Similarly, both Findley (1994) and Henry et al. (2004) show that mobility takes place primarily within rural zones. On the other hand, Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl (2006) and Marchiori, Maystadt, and Schumacher (2012) propose a model where environmental factors lead to urban migration. Other inconsistencies occur with respect to the role of female migration (Findley, 1994;Gray & Mueller, 2011), the impact of natural disasters versus slow-onset climatic changes (Gray & Mueller, 2012;Halliday, 2006), or even sign of the relation between climatic factors and migration (see Black, Kniveton, & Schmidt-Verkerk, 2011;Feng et al., 2010;Munshi, 2003;for Mexico example).\\nWhat is more, a closer examination of the literature suggests that important data issues may be at stake. First, a great number of studies are based on surveys covering a very limited number of individuals, households, and communities, which significantly hinders statistical inference. Second, climatic data itself has not always been available nor reliable, and covers a limited time span in many developing countries, forcing researchers to base their estimations on merely a decade of observations, or on highly extrapolated data. Finally, many studies use rainfall data only, whereas the impact of temperature extremes is found to be much more detrimental to agriculture (Ahmed et al., 2011). Therefore, despite substantial progress in the field of environmental migration, the hybrid narrative of environmental migration requires further investigation.\\nIn this paper, we attempt to address these challenges in a number of ways. Our contribution to the existing literature is threefold. First of all, we employ standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as our principal measure of weather conditions, which is a big improvement over previous studies using temperature or rainfall data only. Recent studies (Vicente-Serrano, Beguería, & López-Moreno, 2010;Vicente-Serrano, Zouber, Lasanta, & Pueyo, 2012) reveal that this index tracks dry or wet conditions better than traditional indices like the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) or Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI); besides, by incorporating temperature and precipitation, it covers the whole range of the potential impacts of temperature, rainfall, and their interactions on crop output. To our knowledge, our paper is the second in the literature on environmental migration that uses SPEI (see Mueller, Gray, & Kosec, 2014). Besides, we base our estimations on high-quality household survey data on Tanzania, covering a large representative sample of households from the whole country. Second, Tanzania agroecological diversity, spanning from semiarid to humid areas, provides enough variation in weather conditions, which is necessary for statistical purposes. Finally, we propose a model in which adverse weather conditions, by reducing agricultural output, prompt households to send their members away in order to secure income sources. Our results suggest that a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural output instrumented with weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average.\",\n",
       "  'Background': 'Tanzania is a pertinent case study for the analysis of the link between weather, agricultural yields and human mobility. In a recent dataset prepared by the Center for Global Development (Wheeler, 2011), the country has been ranked 20th in the world in terms of the extreme weather vulnerability. 1 In the last decade, Tanzania registered two important drought events which led to severe losses in some regions whereas other parts of the country are subject to recurrent flooding. The aggregate indices thus hide important heterogeneity in terms of both current agroclimatic conditions, 2 but also future predictions of climate change impacts.\\nAn empirical analysis of rainfall and temperature suggests a trend of decreasing rainfall between 1922 and 2007, whereas temperature mean and extremes increased by 1.9 and 0.2°C respectively over that period (Mary & Majule, 2009). The same trend can be seen in our data. Several future projections using general circulation models indicate that the interior of the country will experience a 20 per cent decrease in rainfall in June-August season, shortening the rainy season and increasing the risk of drought, whereas precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50 per cent in eastern Tanzania and the Lake Victoria region (Hulme, Doherty, Ngara, New, & Lister, 2001). Temperatures are projected to increase by up to 2.2°C by 2100 (Agrawala et al., 2003). Climate change should therefore be considered an important challenge which Tanzanian households will be about to face in the near future. Even in the short run, they have already been exposed to altered weather patterns: erratic and poorly distributed rainfall, shorter and hotter growing season, and unpredictable start and end of the rainy season, with detrimental consequences for agricultural productivity (Kijazi & Reason, 2012).\\nTanzania, like many Sub-Saharan countries, seems to be particularly vulnerable to increased weather variability because of the role that agriculture plays in the economy and livelihoods: it accounts for about half of gross production, and employs about 80 per cent of the labour force (Thurlow & Wobst, 2003). Agriculture in Tanzania is primarily rain-fed, with only 2 per cent of arable land having irrigation facilities (FAO, 2009), making yields dependent on weather realisation. In a recent study, Rowhani, Lobell, Linderman, and Ramankutty (2011) predict that by 2050, the projected seasonal temperature increase by 2°C in Tanzania will reduce average maize, sorghum, and rice yields by 13, 8.8, and 7.6 per cent respectively. Ahmed et al. (2011) model a spillover effect that this decrease in crop yields will have on other sectors, and especially on food prices, leading to an increase in poverty headcount.\\nWeather shocks, agricultural production and migration 667',\n",
       "  'Data': \"We base our analysis on high quality household survey data. We use the Tanzania National Panel Survey (TZNPS) collected by the National Bureau of Tanzania as part of nationally representative living standard survey (WB's LSMS-ISA). The extensive focus of the survey on agriculture offers a wealth of data. TZNPS include a range of data on 16,709 individuals from 3,265 households. However, since our focus is on households involved in agricultural activities, we end up with a sample of 1,583 farm households for which we have full data. We conduct the analysis at the crosssectional level, using the first 2008/2009 wave as the baseline from which we take pre-migration household characteristics and agricultural production data. Since there is no explicit question on permanent migration in the dataset, the second wave of the survey serves to identify migrants.\\nFor the purpose of this study, we adopt the New Economics of Migration approach (Katz & Stark, 1986;Lucas & Stark, 1985;Stark & Bloom, 1985;Stark & Levhari, 1982) where migration is a collective and not an individual decision; household is therefore the unit of observation. Our dependent variable is a migration dummy for households which sent at least one migrant between the two waves. We identify such households by comparing the place of residence of all households members in the first and the second waves of the survey; thus migration dummy equals one for households with at least one member who permanently moved out of the original village between 2008/09 and 2010/11. 3 Despite the fact that we are interested in economically-driven migration, we do not restrict the sample to working-age individuals: the 2006 Integrated Labour Force Survey suggests that 32 per cent of children aged 5-17 years were employed in economic activities; and nearly half of children were engaged in households tasks. Our results remain unchanged when we exclude children from the analysis.\\nTZNPS provides a range of household characteristics which we use in our estimations (see table A1 in the Online Appendix for details): household labour, that is the number of household members in working age (15 to 64), dummy for female headed households, the highest level of education in the household in years of schooling, physical assetsthat is dwelling and other durables possessedcattle units, 4 and dummy for previous migration experience, which equals one if any household member had previously moved out or into the current location. Detailed agricultural data is also available; for the purpose of this study we use land area in acres and land characteristics such as terrain slope in the agricultural production equation. We use the data on distance to the district capital as a proxy of connectedness or cost of migration. The data on 2008/2009 income (total income and agricultural income) and value of crop production (all aggregates in thousands of Tanzanian shillings) come from the FAO Rural Income Generating Activities (RIGA) database. 5 The RIGA database covers all agricultural households from the TZNPS and all variables available in RIGA were computed based on the original TZNPS dataset. 6  Since the TZNPS provides the GPS coordinates of the households, 7 we are able to match the households from the survey with the corresponding weather data. In our analysis, we employ the SPEI index from the high-resolution (0.5x0.5 degree) gridded dataset by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010). SPEI is an index of deviations from the average water balance, that is precipitations minus potential evapotranspiration. The novelty lies in the fact that 'SPEI includes the role of temperature in drought severity by means of its influence on the atmospheric evaporation demand' (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010). Even though SPEI is oftentimes used as a drought index, we do not put any threshold to assign drought conditions; instead, we use the whole continuum of possible outcomes for both dry (negative values) and wet (positive values) conditions. We apply this measure to the growing season. Tanzania is characterised by both unimodal (November-April) and bimodal rainfall patterns (March-May and October-December); the hottest period occurs between November and February, and the coldest between May and August. In order to account for all these factors, we take the average value of SPEI index for months from January to June. 8 Since we don't know the distribution of households between the two rainfall regimes, we check our results using the average for March-May only, which corresponds to the long masika season in bimodal areas. Alternatively, we use monthly temperature and precipitation from a high-resolution 9 gridded dataset by the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (Harris, Jones, Osborn, & Lister, 2014). We employ them in levels (seasonal mean temperature and precipitation, and squared terms), but we also construct temperature and precipitation shocks, which we define as residual from the 30-year trend modelled with harmonic regression proposed by Helsel and Hirsch (2002).\\nTwo caveats related to the weather data we use have to be taken into account. First, both SPEI and CRU are gridded datasets obtained by means of extrapolation of the data available from meteorological stations. The availability and accuracy of such data in developing countries may be questionable. However, we only use the last 30 years of data, and, as documented in CRU, the number of stations, and therefore the quality of data, improved significantly over that period in comparison to previous years. 10  Second, the use of gridded data implies the possibility of a number of enumeration areas 11 having the same weather observations. In particular, this problem relates to Dar es Salaam. However, since we focus here on agricultural households only, the large majority of households from Dar es Salaam are excluded from our sample. Overall, we find from 1 to 32 households within the same grid cell; however, in 80 per cent of cases, a maximum of three enumeration areas (which corresponds to around 21-23 households) fall into the same cell. We correct this by applying cluster and Moulton correction options.\\n14 per cent of households sent at least one migrant between the two waves (table A1 in the Online Appendix). Even though this figure may seem to be low, and indeed, both quantitative and qualitative studies have documented reluctance towards migration in Tanzania (Beegle, De Werdt, & Dercon, 2011;Mary & Majule, 2009), note that in this study we measure migration flow, that is the proportion of households which sent at least one member away between 2008/2009 and 2010/2011. In particular, if we take into account that TZNPS is a representative survey for the whole country, it would suggest that almost three million people moved in Tanzania just within one year. Note that only 12 per cent of moves are explicitly related to marriage. Besides, as suggested by Rosenzweig and Stark (1989), environmental factors may also play a role in marriage migration decisions. In our dataset, we observe internal migration only. This is consistent with the migration patterns observed in a different household survey conducted in the Kagera region of Tanzania (Kagera Health and Development Survey) which shows that only nine out of 6,000 individuals tracked moved out of the country over the 10-year period. Some important differences can be observed between households with and without new migrants (Table 1). In particular, lower values of 6-and 12-month SPEI point towards more pronounced dry conditions that migrant-sending households experienced in 2008. According to our hypothesis, this is exactly what could have pushed them to relocate some of their members. These households are wealthier, both in terms of current income and assets, proxied by the total livestock units, which is not only a wealth indicator, but also constitutes an important productive asset in Sub-Saharan Africa. Much fewer households in this group are subsistence farmers. 12 Similarly, households who sent migrants are less financially constrained, since they have better access to credit and are more involved in informal assistance groups (SACCOS), even though these differences are not or are barely statistically significant. This may suggest that migration is costly, and that poor households cannot afford it. Finally, households that sent their members away differ significantly along the lines of traditional migration drivers: they are of bigger size and are better educated. On average, more households from this group already have previous migration experience, and the value of remittances they receive in the baseline year is higher than among households that did not send any migrants after 2008.\",\n",
       "  'Estimation Strategy': \"Our specification is motivated by the literature on the New Economics of Migration (Katz & Stark, 1986;Lucas & Stark, 1985;Stark & Bloom, 1985;Stark & Levhari, 1982). A central tenet of this approach is that families evolve economic strategies not only to maximise household earnings, as in Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 669 Harris and Todaro's (1970) model, but also to minimise risk. In our model, which applies to agricultural households in developing countries, the principal source of risk is weather. Like in Feng et al. (2010), the main assumption here is that weather does not impact migration decisions directly, for example through its amenity value or through household preferences for a given climatic setting, and the results from the reduced-form probit regression of SPEI on migration decisions seem to support this hypothesis. In most cases, the coefficients of SPEI are insignificant, both in statistical as well as economic terms, with the only exception of 12-month SPEI significant at 10 per cent level (see table A2 in the Online Appendix). Instead, we posit that weather shocks affect mobility patterns solely through their detrimental impact on agricultural yields. Indeed, since income derived from farming activities constitutes a big share of total income, 13 a negative weather shock not only translates directly into the income shock, but may also have important implications for food security, in particular for subsistence farmers. 14 This, in turn, may prompt households to send some of their members away in order to diversify income sources.\\nOur empirical strategy, therefore, consists of two steps. First, we analyse weather as a risk factor in agriculture and we estimate crop production function. We use the value of agricultural production and not agricultural income since on the one hand, the output is directly affected by weather shocks while income is affected by the corresponding price dynamics in the local markets, and on the other, it allows us to minimise the measurement error associated with income computation based on recall data. We also focus on crop rather than livestock production because in our sample, this is the dominant farming activity: not only 95 per cent of households cultivate crops, but crop production also constitutes by far the largest part in total agricultural production with the median share amounting to 98 per cent. Besides, even though livestock production is certainly affected by climate change, the mechanisms of these changes may not be the same as in cases of plant growth. 15 We model crop production as in Equation (1):\\nY crop;ij ¼ f N ij ; L ij ; LS ij ; S ij ; Shock j À Á þ ij (1)\\nwhere logarithm of crop output is determined as a function of weather shock in a village j, and as a function of household i's number of labourers N ij , land units L ij , livestock units LS ij , and land slope S ij .\\nAs in a typical production function approach, the underlying assumption is that the adaptive capacities within agriculture are low. In the context of our study, this assumption seems to be justified given the short time span of our dataset which is not long enough to adapt productive technology. The observed level of potential adjustments to changing climate is negligible: only 2 per cent of plots are irrigated; fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, and improved seeds are used on 9 per cent of plots. With respect to technology employed, hand power is still dominant with 90 per cent of farmers using hand tools only, and with a mere 0.3 per cent of farmers resorting to mechanic power. As anywhere in the developing world, this may be explained by limited access to finance: only 6 per cent of households in our sample have access to formal credit, and only 5 per cent are involved in savings and credit cooperative organisations, SACCOS. 16  Second, we proceed to estimating migration probability. In light of the assumptions of the model discussed above, weather does not appear in the migration equation directly, but serves as an instrument for agricultural income that is the main explanatory variable in migration decisions. Thus, we apply an IV probit model where Equation ( 2) estimates the determinants of the household i in a village j sending at least one migrant M between 2008 and 2010:\\nM ij ¼ f Y crop;ij ; X ij ; C j À Á þ ε ij(2)\\nY crop;ij is the logarithm of crop production in 2008, one year prior to migration decision. The vector X refers to pre-migration household characteristics at the baseline (2008/2009), such as size of available household labour, gender of household head, the highest level of education within a household, livestock assets, and landholdings. We include these variables to reflect initial endowments that influence the decision to send migrants and are uncorrelated with climate fluctuations. C j denotes cost of migration, proxied by the distance from the village to a district capital. In order to account for the main mechanism in our model, but also to take into account the endogeneity in Equation ( 2), we instrument crop production with weather shock and land slope; the other production factors from Equation (1) appear directly as exogenous variables in Equation ( 2). Technically, therefore, by employing the IV probit method, we calculate the marginal contribution of weather shock, in the main specification proxied by SPEI, to crop production, and use this variable to explain migration decision within a household. One potential caveat in our approach is that weather may affect migration decision through channels other than crop production, such as livelihoods, animal production or off-farm labour productivity. If this is the case, then the assumptions of our model will be violated. However, in the estimation strategy we do not employ baseline climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, long-term means or coefficients of variation, that could be associated with many unobserved socio-ecological characteristics affecting migration propensity within local communities. Second, we conduct parallel analyses for livestock production and off-farm income (see table A4 in the Online Appendix for off-farm income regression), and the results point to the fact that even though weather anomalies have Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 671 a direct impact on both livestock production and off-farm income, these are not the channels through which weather shocks affect migration propensity.\",\n",
       "  'Crop Production Function': \"First, we estimate the impact of weather shock on crop production as in Equation ( 1). As a starting point, we use SPEI at different timescales (1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months) as our principal weather variable. These timescales allow for identifying various types of drought that affect different usable water resources. 17 Recall that SPEI index is normalised with mean zero and standard deviation one, and that negative values indicate drought conditions. 18 Results in Table 2 confirm strong negative impact of drought conditions on crop production. The increase in water deficit by one standard deviation results in a crop production decline by 20 to 30 per cent according to different timescales. The magnitude of SPEI coefficient is thus very important, even if in practice, one standard deviation change in SPEI would entail an important shift in weather conditions; for example, in 2008, the values observed in our dataset ranged from -1.03 to 1.10 in the growing season. Interestingly, statistical significance of SPEI coefficients increases along timescales. This result becomes more apparent when we correct standard errors with cluster 19 and Moulton correction options in order to account for the fact that weather data we use is aggregated at the grid cell level, whereas our estimation is done at the household level. While coefficients for short time scales are not significant at all or are significant only at the 10 per cent level (for sake of brevity, results for short-time scales are not reported here), the results for longer time scales remain highly significant at the 1 or 5 per cent level, as in columns ( 6) to (8). This is consistent with Vicente-Serrano et al.'s (2012) findings, according to which vegetation in semiarid and subhumid areas, which are the focus of our study, tends to respond to drought at longer timescales. 'Vegetation of these regions is adapted to tolerate regular periods of water deficit and has physiological mechanisms to cope with these conditions' (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012). Based on these findings, we choose to include longer timescale SPEI in our preferred specification (12-, 24-, and 48-month indices).\\nIn order to make a reference to previous studies, we also check the impact of weather on crop production using standard weather variables: temperature and precipitation. We draw on studies that use weather variables in levels (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, & Shaw, 1994) and weather shocks (Feng et al., 2010;Kelly, Kolstad, & Mitchell, 2005). Columns ( 4) and ( 9) in Table 2 present the results for temperature and temperature squared in the 2008 growing season and confirm the nonlinear inverted-U shape found in previous studies (Schlenker & Roberts, 2009). We also include precipitation and precipitation squared, 20 but they are not statistically significant. First, as explained by Rowhani et al. (2011), the CRU dataset overestimates rainfall in comparison to data obtained from meteorological stations, while temperature measures are much more consistent. Also, rainfall patterns show much greater spatial heterogeneity than temperature, and such heterogeneity is not fully captured by extrapolated data. Second, recent studies suggest that temperature extremes may be much more detrimental for plant growth than precipitations (Schlenker, Hanemann, & Fisher, 2006). Finally, in columns ( 5) to (10) we also test the impact of temperature and precipitation shocks on crop production. Despite the statistically significant coefficient for the temperature shock, it is worth noting that its magnitude is much smaller than those of SPEI coefficients. The impact of precipitation shock, again, is not significant. These results suggest that the range of weather conditions captured by SPEI is more pertinent to crop growth than a single weather factor.\",\n",
       "  'Migration': 'Table 3 displays the main results for migration IV probit model. For agricultural households, weather shocks appear to be an important migration driver through their impact on crop production. When we apply our preferred specification with long timescales SPEI indices as in columns (1) to ( 3), the results suggest that a 1 per cent decrease in crop production induced by a weather shock increases the \\n( Weather shocks, agricultural production and migration 673 probability of migration within the following year by 9 to almost 13 percentage points on average, 21  depending on the time-scale used. Not only the magnitude, but also the statistical significance of the main coefficient is highest when the weather shock is defined by the SPEI capturing water balance conditions during 12 months. We find the significant impact of crop output deviations on migration decision when we use temperature and precipitation and the squared terms as in column ( 4), and deviation from the trend as in column (5) as well. Findings in column ( 4) should be treated with caution, however, since the results for the temperature and precipitation in levels in the agricultural production equation are not robust to different specifications (Table 2). The estimates in Table 3 confirm the importance of traditional migration drivers: labour force availability, education level and previous migration experience increase the probability of migration, but the magnitude of this impact is much smaller than that of crop production shock. Surprisingly, the effect of the distance to the district capital is almost negligible. On the other hand, as expected, the initial endowment, proxied here by the total livestock units of cattle, turns out to be a significant factor in migration process.\\nTaking into account the role that initial endowments may play in migration, especially in the context of low income and important financial constraints, we explore this issue in detail in Table 4. We divide our sample into three wealth categories and conduct separate estimations for each of them. We apply two measures of wealth: an asset-based wealth index which we constructed by applying Kolenikov and Angeles (2004) polychoric principal component analysis as in columns (1) to ( 3), and expenditures per capita. 22 Independent of the wealth measure used, the results show an interesting pattern: weather-induced crop output shock is an important predictor of migration probability only for households in the middle of the wealth distribution, whereas it is insignificant for the poorest and the richest households. We may expect that the poorest households cannot afford migration costs, while the richest ones may prefer and also afford in-situ adaptation strategies, such as irrigation or droughtresistant crops.

Maurel Finally, in order to test the validity of the agricultural productivity mechanism in our model, we estimate Equation ( 2) separately for households specialised in agriculture, which we define as those households that derive at least 75 per cent of their income from agriculture, and diversified households. The results in columns ( 4) and (5) confirm our expectations. Weather-induced negative crop output shocks play a much more important role for households dependent on agriculture: the coefficient in column ( 4) is more than twice as high than in column (5), both in terms of its magnitude and statistical significance. A similar pattern is observed when we use temperature and precipitation shocks as instruments for crop output, 23 even though the coefficients and their statistical significance are lower, consistent with the previous results. This clearly suggests that farmers specialised in agriculture, who constitute about half of our sample, are the most vulnerable to the impact of deviations in weather patterns.',\n",
       "  'Robustness': 'As a robustness check, we employ a set of estimations using a constrained definition of dependent variable, as well as alternative measures of the main explanatory variable (Table 5). In column (1), we recall our principal results. In column (2), we estimate our model for migrants defined as those individuals who moved a distance greater than 10 km. With this threshold, we exclude very short-distance moves within or in the vicinity of the village of origin. In column (3), we include only individuals of working age (15-year old and older) in order to put emphasis on the economic motivations of migration. For the sake of brevity, we present results only for crop production instrumented with 12-month SPEI. Finally, in columns ( 4) to ( 6), we instrument crop output with SPEI measured uniquely for the long masika season, the most important growing season in regions characterised by bi-modal rainfall patterns. Our principal Notes: Instrumented: logarithm of crop production. Main instrument: SPEI12. Wealth tertiles based on asset-based index based on the polychoric principal component analysis (Kolenikov & Angeles, 2004). Farm specialiser: hh deriving >75 per cent of income from agriculture. Results presented in terms of the average marginal effects. Firststage regressions omitted. Standard errors in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.\\nWeather shocks, agricultural production and migration 675 findings turn out robust to these changes. The magnitude of the coefficients moves only slightly, while their statistical significance remains high at 1 per cent.\\nFinally, we conduct the attrition analysis (see the Online Appendix). Even though low in comparison to most longitudinal surveys (4.5% of individuals from our target sample), the attrition observed in the TZNPS may potentially constitute a serious problem for the analysis of migration. Since residential moves are typically one of the main reasons for non-response in panel surveys (Fitzgerald, Gottschalk, & Moffitt, 1998), it is plausible that attrition in our dataset is not random but instead is systematically associated with the covariates explaining migration decisions. If this were the case, then our estimates based on a sample of non-attritors would be biased. However, we show that despite being non-random, the attrition observed in the sample does not consistently bias our results. The only caveat is that by conducting the analysis based on the sample of non-attritors, we may potentially underestimate the magnitude of our findings.',\n",
       "  'Conclusion': 'We investigate whether Tanzanian households respond to weather risk. We test an IV probit model where migration decision is determined by agricultural income instrumented with standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), but also temperature and precipitation shocks. Our results suggest that weather shocks have a significant negative impact on crop production. As a consequence, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. Interestingly, migration decision appears to be conditional on initial endowment, since only households in the middle of the wealth distribution respond to the weather shock by spatially diversifying their income sources. What is more, such a mechanism where climate variability affects household migration decision through agricultural channel is valid only for households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, while the results are not significant for diversified livelihoods.\\nTo our knowledge, this study is the second to use SPEI index in the literature on environmental migration. Our results showed some important advantages of this multi-scalar index over different measures of temperature and precipitation. SPEI encompasses the whole spectrum of water balance, including the effects of temperature, and is therefore better suited to capture meteorological conditions that have an impact on plant growth and agricultural output.'}}"
